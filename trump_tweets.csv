It was my great honor to join our wonderful Veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Youngstown Ohio this evening. A grateful nation salutes you! 
Joint Press Conference with Prime Minister Saad Hariri of Lebanon beginning shortly. Join us live!
Drain the Swamp should be changed to Drain the Sewer - it's actually much worse than anyone ever thought and it begins with the Fake News!
If Republicans don't Repeal and Replace the disastrous ObamaCare the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand!
It's hard to read the Failing New York Times or the Amazon Washington Post because every story/opinion even if should be positive
It's very sad that Republicans even some that were carried over the line on my back
As the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold
To every PATRIOT who will serve on the #USSGeraldRFord:
American steel &amp; American hands have constructed a 100 000 ton message to the world: American MIGHT IS SECOND TO NONE!
Join me live for the commissioning ceremony of the USS Gerald R. Ford!
ObamaCare is dead and the Democrats are obstructionists no ideas or votes
The Republican Senators must step up to the plate and after 7 years
In all fairness to Anthony Scaramucci he wanted to endorse me 1st
My son Donald openly gave his e-mails to the media &amp; authorities whereas Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted (&amp; acid washed) her 33 000 e-mails!
...What about all of the Clinton ties to Russia including Podesta Company
So many people are asking why isn't the A.G. or Special Council looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes. 33 000 e-mails deleted?
While all agree the U. S. President has the complete power to pardon why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us.FAKE NEWS
This morning I will be going to the Commissioning Ceremony for the largest aircraft carrier in the world The Gerald R. Ford. Norfolk
The Failing New York Times foiled U.S. attempt to kill the single most wanted terrorist Al-Baghdadi.Their sick agenda over National Security

ISIS is on the run &amp; will soon be wiped out of Syria &amp; Iraq illegal border crossings are way down (75%) &amp; MS 13 gangs are being removed.
Remember when you hear the words sources say from the Fake Media
My son Donald did a good job last night. He was open transparent and innocent. This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad!
My son Donald
Big wins against ISIS!
Marine Plane crash in Mississippi is heartbreaking. Melania and I send our deepest condolences to all!
Working hard to get the Olympics for the United States (L.A.). Stay tuned!
The Senate Democrats have only confirmed 48 of 197 Presidential Nominees. They can't win so all they do is slow things down &amp; obstruct!
If Chelsea Clinton were asked to hold the seat for her mother as her mother gave our country away
When I left Conference Room for short meetings with Japan and other countries I asked Ivanka to hold seat. Very standard. Angela M agrees!
I cannot imagine that Congress would dare to leave Washington without a beautiful new HealthCare bill fully approved and ready to go!
James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media. That is so illegal!
The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit doesn't mean I think it can happen. It can't-but a ceasefire can &amp; did!
Syrian ceasefire seems to be holding. Many lives can be saved. Came out of meeting. Good!
For years even as a civilian
...whether there are tapes or recordings of my conversations with James Comey but I did not make
With all of the recently reported electronic surveillance intercepts
I certainly hope the Democrats do not force Nancy P out. That would be very bad for the Republican Party - and please let Cryin' Chuck stay!
...Why did the DNC REFUSE to turn over its Server to the FBI and still hasn't? It's all a big Dem scam and excuse for losing the election!
...Why did Democratic National Committee turn down the DHS offer to protect against hacks (long prior to election). It's all a big Dem HOAX!
By the way if Russia was working so hard on the 2016 Election
Former Homeland Security Advisor Jeh Johnson is latest top intelligence official to state there was no grand scheme between Trump &amp; Russia.

Despite the phony Witch Hunt going on in America the economic &amp; jobs numbers are great. Regulations way down
The Fake News Media hates when I use what has turned out to be my very powerful Social Media - over 100 million people! I can go around them
After 7 months of investigations &amp; committee hearings about my collusion with the Russians nobody has been able to show any proof. Sad!
"#CongressionalBaseballGameCrooked H destroyed phones w/ hammer 'bleached' emails"""
Why is that Hillary Clintons family and Dems dealings with Russia are not looked at but my non-dealings are?
You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history - led by some very bad and conflicted people! #MAGA
They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story found zero proof
Just left hospital. Rep. Steve Scalise one of the truly great people

2 million more people just dropped out of ObamaCare. It is in a death spiral. Obstructionist Democrats gave up have no answer = resist!
Heading to the Great State of Wisconsin to talk about JOBS JOBS
Fake News is at an all time high. Where is their apology to me for all of the incorrect stories???
A.G. Lynch made law enforcement decisions for political purposes...gave Hillary Clinton a free pass and protection. Totally illegal!
Well as predicted
The Fake News Media has never been so wrong or so dirty. Purposely incorrect stories and phony sources to meet their agenda of hate. Sad!
Congratulations!
We will NEVER FORGET the victims who lost their lives one year ago today in the horrific #PulseNightClub shooting.… 
Great numbers on the economy. All of our work including the passage of many bills &amp; regulation killing Executive Orders
My daughter Ivanka

So good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off. They said they would take a hard line on funding...
Sorry folks but if I would have relied on the Fake News of CNN
During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar - look!
The FAKE MSM is working so hard trying to get me not to use Social Media. They hate that I can get the honest and unfiltered message out.
Big meeting today with Republican leadership concerning Tax Cuts and Healthcare. We are all pushing hard - must get it right!
That's right we need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS countries
Today I announced an Air Traffic Control Initiative to take American air travel into the future - finally!
Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his no reason to be alarmed statement. MSM is working hard to sell it!
In any event we are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U.S. in order to help keep our country safe. The courts are slow and political!
The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - &amp; seek much tougher version!
The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban not the watered down
People the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want
Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? That's because they used knives and a truck!
At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is no reason to be alarmed!
We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we don't get smart it will only get worse
Whatever the United States can do to help out in London and the U. K. we will be there - WE ARE WITH YOU. GOD BLESS!
We need to be smart vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss!
I would have done even better in the election if that is possible
Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult &amp; sophisticated than the popular vote. Hillary focused on the wrong states!
Yes it is true - Carlos Slim
especially how to get people even with an unlimited budget

It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4--
In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally
Trump is going to be our President. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead. So much time and money will be spent - same result! Sad

The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!

New polls are good because the media has deceived the public by putting women front and center with made-up stories and lies and got caught
Journalists shower Hillary Clinton with campaign cash
WikiLeaks proves even the Clinton campaign knew Crooked mishandled classified info but no one gets charged? RIGGED! 
We have all got to come together and win this election. We can't have four more years of Obama (or worse!).
Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!
Can't believe these totally phoney stories 100% made up by women (many already proven false) and pushed big time by press
ALL SAFE IN ORANGE COUNTY NORTH CAROLINA. With you all the way
Wow interview released by Wikileakes shows quid pro quo in Crooked Hillary e-mail probe.Such a dishonest person - &amp; Paul Ryan does zilch!

The Democrats have a corrupt political machine pushing crooked Hillary Clinton. We have Paul Ryan always fighting the Republican nominee!
Join me in Wisconsin tomorrow or Colorado on Tuesday!
“The vast majority felt she should be prosecuted... -- even senior FBI officials thought Crooked was guilty.
The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD
We've all wondered how Hillary avoided prosecution for her email scheme. Wikileaks may have found the answer. Obama! 
Hillary's staff thought her email scandal might just blow over. Who would trust these people with national security? 
A country that Crooked Hillary says has funded ISIS also gave Wild Bill $1 million for his birthday? SO CORRUPT! 
They let Crooked &amp; the Gang off the hook for the crime but it looks like the cover-up is just as bad. Unbelievable! 
Election is being rigged by the media in a coordinated effort with the Clinton campaign
Polls close but can you believe I lost large numbers of women voters based on made up events THAT NEVER HAPPENED. Media rigging election!

Terrible attacks in NY NJ and MN this weekend. Thinking of victims

HAPPY BIRTHDAY - to the United States Air Force!! 
I would like to express my warmest regards best wishes and condolences to all of the families and victims of the horrible bombing in NYC.
Never met but never liked dopey Robert Gates. Look at the mess the U.S. is in. Always speaks badly of his many bosses including Obama.
Heading to Colorado for a big rally. Massive crowd great people! Will be there soon - the polls are looking good.
I never met former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. He knows nothing about me. But look at the results under his guidance - a total disaster!

Final poll results from NBC on last nights Commander-in-Chief Forum. Thank you! #ImWithYou #MAGA 
It wasn't Matt Lauer that hurt Hillary last night. It was her very dumb answer about emails &amp; the veteran who said she should be in jail.
More poll results from last nights Commander-in-Chief Forum.
Last nights results - in poll taken by NBC. #AmericaFirst #ImWithYou 
With Luis Mexico and the United States would have made wonderful deals together - where both Mexico and the US would have benefitted.
Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Peña Nieto.
Hillary Clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past. She is totally confused. Unfit to serve as #POTUS.
Thank you! #AmericaFirst 
As a tribute to the late great Phyllis Schlafly
China wouldn't provide a red carpet stairway from Air Force One and then Philippines President calls Obama the son of a whore. Terrible!

Now that African-Americans are seeing what a bad job Hillary type policy and management has done to the inner-cities they want TRUMP!
Crooked Hillary's brainpower is highly overrated.Probably why her decision making is so bad or as stated by Bernie S
Does anyone know that Crooked Hillary who tried so hard
CLINTON CORRUPTION AND HER SABOTAGE OF THE INNER CITIES.
Hillary Clinton only knows how to make a speech when it is a hit on me. No policy and always very short (stamina). Media gives her a pass!
HRC is using the oldest play in the Dem playbook- when their policies fail they are left w/this one tired argument!
Hillary Clinton is using race-baiting to try to get African-American voters- but they know she is all talk and NO ACTION!
Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself!
Just watched recap of #CrookedHillary's speech. Very short and lies. She is the only one fear-mongering!
So many in the African-American community are doing so badly poverty and crime way up

Statement on Clinton Foundation:
Some day when things calm down

Morning Joe's weakness is its low ratings. I don't watch anymore but I heard he went wild against Rudy Giuliani and #2A - sad &amp; irrelevant!
Media desperate to distract from Clinton's anti-2A stance. I said pro-2A citizens must organize and get out vote to save our Constitution!

Hillary Clinton has bad judgment and is unfit to serve as President.
The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva Switzerland
President Obama refuses to answer question about Iran terror funding. I won't dodge questions as your President. 
Obama's disastrous judgment gave us ISIS rise of Iran
President Obama should ask the DNC about how they rigged the election against Bernie.

During the GOP convention CNN cut away from the victims of illegal immigrant violence. They don’t want them heard. 
When will CNN do a segment on Hillary’s plan to increase Syrian refugees 550% and how much it will cost?
Hillary Clinton raked in money from regimes that horribly oppress women and gays &amp; refuses to speak out against Radical Islam.
Hillary whose decisions have led to the deaths of many
Crooked Hillary Clinton is 100% owned by her donors. #ImWithYou #MAGA 
Thank you Columbus Ohio! I will be back soon. #ImWithYou #MAGA 
Thank you Oklahoma &amp; Virginia!
People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary....that's really saying something!
The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life.
Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary?
When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary's pay-for-play at State Department?
CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime failing schools and vanishing jobs.
CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton.
Join Governor Mike Pence in Reno Nevada- tonight at 7pm! Tickets available at:

So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That's what I said!
When I said in an interview that Putin is not going into Ukraine you can mark it down
The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why then
I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war not me!
Captain Khan killed 12 years ago
We crushed the original goal! I will write a $2 MILLION check to our campaign if we hit our end-of-month goal!

Crooked's stop in Johnstown Pennsylvania
#CrookedHillary = Obama's third term which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below. 
Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?
I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics they will do much better!
Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two Big Thursdays when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings
#CrookedHillary 
Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime supports open borders
Violent crime is rising across the United States yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities.
I will write a $2 MILLION check to our campaign if we hit our million-dollar end-of-month goal!

Hillary can never win over Bernie supporters. Her foreign wars
Colorado was amazing yesterday! So much support. Our tax trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to Colorado and the whole country.
Thank you Denver Colorado!
As usual Hillary &amp; the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games. Same as last time w/ Bernie. Unacceptable!
#CrookedHillary Job Application 
Hillary Clinton should not be given national security briefings in that she is a lose cannon with extraordinarily bad judgement &amp; insticts.
Thank you to the amazing law enforcement officers in Colorado!
Thank you Colorado Springs. Get out &amp; VOTE #TrumpPence16 in November! 
Median household income is down for the middle class since Obama took office. It will only go further down under Clinton.
A vote for Clinton-Kaine is a vote for TPP NAFTA
AMERICA'S FUTURE
Our country does not feel 'great already' to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty violence and despair.

Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic
Our not very bright Vice President Joe Biden
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!
Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!
The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!
As I have been saying Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election
Just like I have warned from the beginning Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP.
Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep?
I hate to say it but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!
No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated!
I'm with you! I will work hard and never let you down. Make America Great Again! 
I'm with you! I will work hard and never let you down. Make America Great Again! 
I’m with you! I will work hard and never let you down. Make America Great Again! 
For the record I have ZERO investments in Russia.
In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy!
Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS &amp; her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.
Bernie's exhausted he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!
The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!
Thank you New Hampshire!
Join us in Toledo Ohio- tomorrow night at 8pm! #TrumpPence16 #MAGA
Join us tomorrow in Scranton Pennsylvania at 3pm!
Pocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch.
Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS bad trade deals
Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work energy and money
Elizabeth Warren often referred to as Pocahontas
Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.
If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.
Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time energy and money. The V.P. a joke!
While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.
Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP is in pocket of Wall Street
Thank you OHIO! #TrumpPence16
Thank you Roanoke Virginia- be back soon! #TrumpPence16
MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN! #TrumpPence16
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don't want another four years of Obama and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGA
The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!
Wow the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not
Here we go again with another Clinton scandal and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her servant was doing at the DNC - they just got caught that's all! They laughed at Bernie.
If Bernie Sanders after seeing the just released e-mails
Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!
How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails using even religion
The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails which should never have been written (stupid)
Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS &amp; all others laughing!
The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good but for the final night
The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory
The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp; well!
Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!
Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out
If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie)
I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted no energy left!
Sorry folks but Bernie Sanders is exhausted
There is no longer a Bernie Sanders political revolution. He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure wants it all to end!
An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.
Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not their BLOOD
Wow President Obama's brother
Bernie Sanders started off strong but with the selection of Kaine for V.P.
The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart!
The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her unless he is a fraud!
Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!
I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!
Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!
Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!
Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.
Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes really vicious. RIGGED
Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also Crooked Hillary hates her!
Tim Kaine is and always has been
The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?
I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.
Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?
Another attack this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.
One of the best produced including the incredible stage &amp; set
Thank you Cleveland. We love you and will be back many times!
What a great four days in Cleveland. So proud of the great job done by the RNC and all. The police and Secret Service were fantastic!

Thank you Mahoning County Ohio! See you soon! #MakeAmericaSafeAgain
President Obama just had a news conference but he doesn't have a clue. Our country is a divided crime scene
Our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching. We are not looking good we are not looking smart
We are TRYING to fight ISIS and now our own people are killing our police. Our country is divided and out of control. The world is watching
We grieve for the officers killed in Baton Rouge today. How many law enforcement and people have to...
If Goofy Elizabeth Warren a very weak Senator
I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas
It doesn't matter that Crooked Hillary has experience look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement!
As the days and weeks go by we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions!
We are going to have a great time in Cleveland. Will lead to special results for our country. We will Make America Great Again!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren who may be the least productive Senator in the U.S. Senate
Thank you to Jack Morgan Tamara Neo

Crooked Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street lobbyists and special interests. She will sell our country down the tubes!
Very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes Crooked Hillary Clinton
Crooked Hillary who embarrassed herself and the country with her e-mail lies
Crooked Hillary is spending big Wall Street money on ads saying I don't have foreign policy experience yet look what her policies have done
Look forward to introducing Governor Mike Pence (who has done a spectacular job in the great State of Indiana). My first choice from start!
Look forward to Governor Mike Pence V.P. introduction tomorrow in New York City.
I am pleased to announce that I have chosen Governor Mike Pence as my Vice Presidential running mate. News conference tomorrow at 11:00 A.M.
Four more years of weakness with a Crooked Hillary Administration is not acceptable. Look what has happened to the world with O &amp; Hillary!
#NeverTrump is never more. They were crushed last night in Cleveland at Rules Committee by a vote of 87-12. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
My prayers and condolences to the victims and families of the terrible tragedy in Nice France. We are with you in every way!

Another new poll. Thank you for your support! Join the MOVEMENT today!
Great new poll- thank you America!
I will be making the announcement of my Vice Presidential pick on Friday at 11am in Manhattan. Details to follow.
If I win the Presidency we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions!
Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!
On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others.
Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.
Lyin' Crooked Hillary's email stories all have one thing in common. 
Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves? Think about it and let me know!
The Republican platform is most
New GOP platform now includes language that supports the border wall. We will build the wall and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!
#CrookedHillary is outspending me by a combined 31 to 1 in Florida Ohio
Thank you Florida Ohio
Thank you! #ImWithYou 
Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot - resign!
THANK YOU INDIANA! #Trump2016 
Thank you Iowa- see you soon!
The American people agree. No free pass for #CrookedHillary! 
To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals &amp; global special interests we welcome you with open arms. People first.
Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton.
Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.
#CrookedHillary is not qualified!
I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out!
Bernie Sanders who has lost most of his leverage
This election is a choice between law order &amp; safety - or chaos
For too many years our inner cities have been left behind. I am going to deliver jobs
Crime is out of control and rapidly getting worse. Look what is going on in Chicago and our inner cities. Not good!
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #ImWithYou
Senior United States District Judge Robert E. Payne today ruled in favor of Trump campaign delegates who had argued..

Thoughts and prayers with the victims and their families- along with everyone at the Berrien County Courthouse in St. Joseph
Join me in Westfield Indiana- tomorrow night at 7:30pm! #Trump2016
The media is so dishonest. If I make a statement they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish.They think the public is stupid!
President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe!
Look what is happening to our country under the WEAK leadership of Obama and people like Crooked Hillary Clinton. We are a divided nation!
New poll - thank you! #Trump2016
MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!
Due to the horrific events taking place in our country I have decided to postpone my speech on economic opportunity- today in Miami.
Last night's horrific execution-style shootings of 12 Dallas law enforcement officers...
Prayers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our country
After today Crooked Hillary can officially be called Lyin' Crooked Hillary.
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
Thank you Rep. Collins! #Trump2016

Great being in Cincinnati Ohio last night- thank you! Off to Washington D.C. now. #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst 
Where is the outrage for this Disney book? Is this the 'Star of David' also?
To all of my twitter followers please contribute whatever you can to the campaign. We must beat Crooked Hillary. 
Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd a man with so little touch for politics
Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City.
Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center Airport - and destroyed City
I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes
Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch her time will come!
The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges but... 
Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest incompetent and of very bad judgement.
Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive highly classified information. Not fit!
Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!
I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with murder. Come November 8 she's out!
Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win
Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace!
Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?
With Hillary and Obama the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools
Crooked Hillary Clinton is guilty as hell but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33 000 missing e-mails?
The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked!
Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed great people!
Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd the end result was solid!
Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star or plain star!
Happy 4th of July! #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst 
Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change!
The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!
In Bangladesh hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!
I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!
The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting go away no pictures.
Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about grandkids and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?
THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!
On Saturday a great man Elie Wiesel
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged &amp; corrupt!
Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.
It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said the system is totally rigged!
It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!
Thank you for your support!
Thank you! #AmericaFirst 
If I become the next POTUS- they will not be ignoring! #AmericaFirst
Crooked Hillary -- Makes History!
The #2A to our Constitution is clear. The right of the people to keep &amp; bear Arms shall not be infringed upon.

These crimes won't be happening if I'm elected POTUS. Killer should have never been here. #AmericaFirst
Yet another terrorist attack today in Israel -- a father shot at by a Palestinian terrorist
Horrible killing of a 13 year old American girl at her home in Israel by a Palestinian terrorist. We must get tough. 
Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton. The system is totally rigged. Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?
Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret. Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.
As Bernie Sanders said Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!
The reason I put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. I have totally terminated the loan!
One of the reasons Hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich- selling out America.
Why would college graduates want Crooked Hillary as their President? She will destroy them!
Tremendous day in Massachusetts and Maine. Thank you to everyone for making it so special!
ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!
Will be in Bangor Maine today! Join me- 4pmE at the Cross Insurance Center! 
New Q poll out- we are going to win the whole deal- and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #Trump2016 
Why would the USChamber be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that I want penalties for cheaters?
Iron Mike Tyson was not asked to speak at the Convention though I'm sure he would do a good job if he was. The media makes everything up!
Check it out - 2nd video on Lying Crooked Hillary is now online! Watch it here:
The media is unrelenting. They will only go with and report a story in a negative light. I called Brexit (Hillary was wrong) watch November
Crooked Hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the U.S. Senate goofy Elizabeth Warren
Crooked Hillary Attacks Foreign Government Donations - While Ignoring Her Own: 
Crooked Hillary Clinton got Brexit wrong. I said LEAVE will win. She has no sense of markets and such bad judgement. Only a question of time
Hillary Clinton is not a change agent just the same old status quo! She is spending a fortune
People in our country want borders and without them the old line pols like Crooked Hillary will not win. It is time for CHANGE -- and JOBS!
Top 50 Facts About Crooked Hillary Clinton From Trump 'Stakes Of The Election' Address: 
Crooked Hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at Turnberry. Shows me hitting shot but I never did = lie! Was there to support son
Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on BREXIT with big dollar ads. Disgraceful!
Crooked Hillary Clinton who called BREXIT 100% wrong (along with Obama)
George Will one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago)
Just landed in New York - a one night stay in Scotland. Turnberry came out magnificently. My son Eric
Obama has blocked ICE officers and BP from doing their jobs. That ends when I am President!
I have never liked the media term 'mass deportation' -- but we must enforce the laws of the land!
We only want to admit those who love our people and support our values. #AmericaFirst
We must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place.
So funny Crooked Hillary called BREXIT so incorrectly
Thoughts and prayers are with everyone in West Virginia- dealing with the devastating floods. #ImWithYou

In just out book Secret Service Agent Gary Byrne doesn't believe that Crooked Hillary has the temperament or integrity to be the president!
A former Secret Service Agent for President Clinton excoriates Crooked Hillary describing her as ERRATIC &amp; VIOLENT. Bad temperament for pres
they made the change without giving me credit.
Remembering the fallen heroes on #DDay - June 6 1944. 
I am getting bad marks from certain pundits because I have a small campaign staff. But small is good flexible
A massive blow to Obama's message - only 38 000 new jobs for month in just issued jobs report. That's REALLY bad!
Crooked Hillary is being badly criticized (for a Wall Street paid for ad) by PolitiFact for a false ad on me on women. She is a total fraud!
Crooked Hillary Clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. Her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions!
Just like I have been able to spend far less money than others on the campaign and finish #1 so too should our country. We can be great!
Hillary Clinton is unfit to be president. She has bad judgement poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record. Change!
Thank you Attorney General Gonzales so many people feel this way.
We just had the worst jobs report since 2010.
The Mayor of San Jose did a terrible job of ordering the protection of innocent people. The thugs were lucky supporters remained peaceful!
Many of the thugs that attacked the peaceful Trump supporters in San Jose were illegals. They burned the American flag and laughed at police
Muhammad Ali is dead at 74! A truly great champion and a wonderful guy. He will be missed by all!
Thank you Redding California!
Great evening in San Jose other than the thugs. My supporters are far tougher if they want to be but fortunately they are not hostile.
I'm a former chief of police in a border town. I'm Hispanic I'm proud to be Hispanic and I'm 100% behind Trump.
In Crooked Hillary's telepromter speech yesterday she made up things that I said or believe but have no basis in fact. Not honest!
Rally last night in San Jose was great. Tremendous love and enthusiasm in the hall. Big crowd. Outside small group of thugs burned Am flag!
Terrible jobs report just reported. Only 38 000 jobs added. Bombshell!
Then on June 25th- back to the USA to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn't even look presidential!
Crooked Hillary no longer has credibility - too much failure in office. People will not allow another four years of incompetence!
Crooked Hillary Clinton who I would love to call Lyin' Hillary
After the litigation is disposed of and the case won I have instructed my execs to open Trump U(?)
Even though I have a very biased and unfair judge in the Trump U civil case in San Diego I have thousands of great reviews &amp; will win case!
With all of the Crooked Hillary Clinton's foreign policy experience she has made so many mistakes - and I mean real monsters! No more HRC.
Join me in San Jose California- tonight!
Wow USA Today did todays cover story on my record in lawsuits. Verdict: 450 wins
Bernie Sanders was right when he said that Crooked Hillary Clinton was not qualified to be president because she suffers from BAD judgement!
Crooked Hillary Clinton has zero natural talent - she should not be president. Her temperament is bad and her decision making ability-zilch!
The endorsement of me by the 16 500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate. Nice!
In getting the endorsement of the 16 500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you)
Obama says a WALL at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W.H.
If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent say good bye to the Supreme Court!
The Republican Party has to be smart &amp; strong if it wants to win in November. Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate!
Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser but if the GOP can't control their own
Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do.
Heading to D.C. to see and hear ROLLING THUNDER. Amazing people that LOVE OUR COUNTRY. Great spirit!
Honor Memorial Day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country! We love them.
Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he's in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost. #MDW
Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me!
The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money &amp; get much better results! What we need as Prez!
I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary - by a lot - and with many states left to go! Thank you.
The U.S. has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders. How nice but what do we get? NOT ENOUGH

Thank you Anaheim California!
Thank you Washington! Honored to say on behalf of our great movement
The protesters in New Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican flag. The rally inside was big and beautiful but outside

Great rally in New Mexico amazing crowd! Now in L.A. Big rally in Anaheim.
Thank you Washington! #Trump2016
After raising w/ no obligation
Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs. Most importantly
I just released my financial disclosure forms the largest numbers in the history of the F.E.C. Even the dishonest media thinks great!
Amazingly with all of the money I have raised for the vets
Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups.
While under no obligation to do so I have raised between 5 &amp; 6 million dollars
Join me in California or Montana!
Montana

Thank you America! #Trump2016 
The American people are sick and tired of not being able to lead normal lives and to constantly be on the lookout for terror and terrorists!
Bernie Sanders is continuing his quest because he believes that Crooked Hillary Clinton will be forced out of the race - e-mail scandal!
Join me on Wednesday May 25th at the Anaheim Convention Center!
Crooked Hillary wants a radical 500% increase in Syrian refugees. We can’t allow this. Time to get smart and protect America!
How can Crooked Hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical Islam which horribly oppresses women?
Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad! Would be four more years of stupidity!
Crooked Hillary said that I want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!
Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed. No more guns to protect Hillary!
While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day the TSA is falling apart
Crooked Hillary is spending tremendous amounts of Wall Street money on false ads against me. She is a very dishonest person!
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment. No gun owner can ever vote for Clinton!
I am on my way! See you all soon! 
Congratulations to THE MOVEMENT we have just won THE GREAT STATE OF OREGON. The vote percentage is even higher than anticipated! Thank you.
Thank you Oregon! #Trump2016
I look so forward to debating Crooked Hillary Clinton! Democrat Primaries are rigged e-mail investigation is rigged - so time to get it on!
I like Michael Douglas!
Wall Street paid for ad is a fraud just like Crooked Hillary! Their main line had nothing to do with women
Do you think Crooked Hillary will finally close the deal? If she can't win Kentucky she should drop out of race. System rigged!
How can Crooked Hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for NAFTA the worst economic deal in U.S. history?
Crooked Hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economy.If so he should run
#VoteTrump at clerk's offices &amp; 185 ballot drop boxes in #ORPrimary!
Crooked Hillary can't close the deal with Bernie Sanders. Will be another bad day for her!
Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U.S. political history
Oregon is voting today. Keep the big numbers going - VOTE TRUMP! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women. Can't believe she would misrepresent the facts! My hit was on China
The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. You can tell them to go BLANK themselves - was about China NOT WOMEN!
Wow 30
What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly and for years
I gave a woman named Barbara Res a top N.Y. construction job when that was unheard of
Great new poll- thank you! 
If Crooked Hillary Clinton can't close the deal on Crazy Bernie how is she going to take on China
Senator Lindsey Graham called me yesterday very much to my surprise
couldn’t care less about the American worker…does nothing to help!
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
I don't want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love watching what he is doing to Crooked Hillary. His time will come!

Thank you West Virginia. Let's keep it going. Go out and vote on Tuesday - we will win big. #Trump2016

Oregon:
Happy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! 
Join me in Charleston WV - tomorrow! 
I would rather run against Crooked Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against Bernie!
What a great evening we had. So interesting that Sanders beat Crooked Hillary. The dysfunctional system is totally rigged against him!
Thank you Indiana we were just projected to be the winner. We have won in every category. You are very special people-I will never forget!
Thank you Indiana! #Trump2016
Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will and must
Wow Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure - not very presidential. Sad!

Everybody is talking about the protesters burning the American flags and proudly waving Mexican flags. I want America First - so do voters!
Gov Mike Pence has just stated that Donald Trump has taken a strong stance on Hoosier jobs and he thanks me! I will bring back jobs to USA.
Crooked Hillary Clinton said she is used to dealing with men who get off the reservation. Actually she has done poorly with such men!

Trump locks down Delaware GOP delegates. #Trump2016 #MAGA
The economy is bad and getting worse-almost ZERO growth this quarter. Nobody can beat me on the economy (and jobs). MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
The protesters in California were thugs and criminals. Many are professionals. They should be dealt with strongly by law enforcement!
We are now at 1001 delegates. We will win on the first ballot and are not wasting time and effort on other ballots because system is rigged!
Thank you Indiana! #Trump2016 
Crooked Hillary Clinton perhaps the most dishonest person to have ever run for the presidency
Wow the ridiculous deal made between Lyin'Ted Cruz and 1 for 42 John Kasich has just blown up. What a dumb deal - dead on arrival!
Thank you Costa Mesa California! 31

So many false and phony T.V. commercials being broadcast in Indiana. Reminds me of Florida where thousands were put up-I won in a landslide!
I will be in Evansville Indiana
Lyin' Ted Cruz who can never beat Hillary Clinton and has NO path to victory
Thank you to all for the wonderful reviews of my foreign policy speech. I will soon be speaking in great detail on numerous other topics!

Thank you Wilkes-Barre Pennsylvania!
Get out and VOTE tomorrow! We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Passing what was once a vibrant manufacturing area in Pennsylvania. So sad! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
Thank you West Chester Pennsylvania!
Thank you Warwick Rhode Island!
Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.
Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!
Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors &amp; special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!
Wow just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!
I will be in Maryland this afternoon for a major rally. Things are looking good for Tuesday!
As soon as John Kasich is hit with negative ads he will drop like a rock in the polls against Crooked Hillary Clinton. I will win!
I had a great day campaigning in Connecticut. Looking for a big vote on Tuesday!
Lynne Ryan -- just read your great story in the NY Times -- I am proud of you. Thanks! 
Thank you Delaware! #Trump2016
Thank you Bridgeport Connecticut!

Thank you California! See you soon!
Thank you for the incredible support Maryland! This is a movement!
I met Prince on numerous occasions. He was an amazing talent and wonderful guy. He will be greatly missed!
Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted.
Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!
Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!
Thank you Maryland- what a great way to conclude the day! Will be back soon. #Trump2016 
We are going to bring steel and manufacturing back to Indiana!
Thank you Indiana! Will be back soon!
Off to Indiana! #Trump2016 
Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race. Now all he can do is be a spoiler never a nice thing to do. I will beat Hillary!
Join me in Indianapolis Indiana tomorrow at 3pm! #Trump2016
Thank you Eric! 
A big day for New York and for our COUNTRY! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Thank you Buffalo! #NYPrimary
New York we will make America great again! 
Kasich only looks O.K. in polls against Hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed ZERO negative ads against him
Lyin' Ted Cruz can't win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bosses-I am millions of VOTES ahead! Hillary would destroy him &amp; K
The people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians. Biggest story in politics. This will not be allowed!
How is it possible that the people of the great State of Colorado never got to vote in the Republican Primary? Great anger - totally unfair!
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
I win a state in votes and then get non-representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign. Bad system!
Bernie Sanders says that Hillary Clinton is unqualified to be president. Based on her decision making ability I can go along with that!
Isn't it a shame that the person who will have by far the most delegates and many millions more votes than anyone else me
So great to be in New York. Catching up on many things (remember I am still running a major business while I campaign) and loving it!
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
Unbelievable evening. Just made a speech in front 17 000 amazing New Yorkers in Bethpage

A GREAT DAY IN WISCONSIN!
Join me on Monday April 4th in Milwaukee! #WIPrimary #Trump2016
Wisconsin has suffered a great loss of jobs and trade but if I win
I will be in Wisconsin until the election. Jobs trade and immigration will be big factors. I will bring jobs back home - make great deals!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
just put out a Wisconsin ad talking about trade?
My new radio ad airing today in Wisconsin! See you soon!
500 border patrol agents have issue a presidential primary endorsement—me! Thank you.
The Club For Growth said in their ad that 465 delegates (Cruz) plus 143 delegates (Kasich) is more than my 739 delegates. Try again!

The Trump Doctrine: Peace Through Strength. #Trump2016
Just released that international gangs are all over our cities. This will end when I am President!
The United States cannot continue to make such bad one-sided trade deals. There are only so many jobs we can give up. No more!
Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming
Why can't the pundits be honest? Hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again. I will make it strong and great! JOBS!
Another radical Islamic attack this time in Pakistan
Happy Easter to all have a great day!
My statement on NATO being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive (and unfair) for the U.S. are now finally
Remember I am the only candidate who is self-funding. While I am given little credit for this by the voters
Wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in U.S. jobs are leaving. I will make our economy strong again - bring in jobs
Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J. Trump. Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. Illegals out!
Lyin' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq.were caused by me. I had NOTHING to do with story!
The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women when they know that it is just the opposite!
The media is so after me on women Wow this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump!
Top suspect in Paris massacre Salah Abdeslam
Wow just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me. How am I still number one - by a lot?
I didn't start the fight with Lyin'Ted Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania he did. He knew the PAC was putting it out - hence
Just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it. If I lost-monster story!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
Europe and the U.S. must immediately stop taking in people from Syria. This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it! So sad!
Just announced that as many as 5000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe. Also many in U.S. I TOLD YOU SO! I alone can fix this problem!
Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. TIME FOR A CHANGE I WILL SOLVE - AND FAST!
It is amazing how often I am right only to be criticized by the media. Illegal immigration
These politicians like Cruz and Graham who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years
We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N.A.T.O. Why? It is time to renegotiate and the time is now!
N.A.T.O. is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race!
I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted. Jeb spent more than $150 000
I can’t blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion!
Thank you Arizona! #Trump2016
Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. That's why we call him Lyin' Ted!
Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices!
Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you I will never forget!
Thank you Arizona! #Trump2016
Incompetent Hillary despite the horrible attack in Brussels today
Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful Lyin' Ted
Pres. Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately &amp; get home to Washington- where a #POTUS under a serious emergency belongs!
Obama and all others
#VoteTrump video: 
My heart &amp; prayers go out to all of the victims of the terrible #Brussels tragedy. This madness must be stopped and I will stop it.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
President Obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in Cuba especially in the shadows of Brussels. He is being treated badly!
Do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place Brussels was. Not anymore it is from a different world! U.S. must be vigilant and smart!
Wow President Obama just landed in Cuba
Big Republican Dinner tonight at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. I will be there!
The protesters blocked a major highway yesterday delaying entry to my RALLY in Arizona by hours
Why is it that the horrendous protesters who scream
The rallies in Utah and Arizona were great! Tremendous crowds and spirit. Just returned but will be going back soon.
Thank you- New York! I love you!
Landing in Phoenix now. Tomorrow's events will be amazing! #Trump2016
Heading to Phoneix. Will be arriving soon. Tomorrow a big day. Tremendous crowds expected! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Just leaving Salt Lake City Utah- fantastic crowd with no interruptions.
Why haven't they released the final Missouri victory for us yet? Could it be because Cruz's guy runs Missouri?
I guess I have reached yet another ceiling - 49.7% with four people. My highest Reuters poll yet! Thank you! 
Do you believe that Hillary Clinton now wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants? She should spend more time taking care of our great Vets!
Thank you Arizona- I love you!
Join me tomorrow! #Trump2016
Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost!
Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich &amp; Marco Rubio and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz. 1/2
Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney the man who choked and let us all down
Going to Salt Lake City Utah
Club for Growth letter- trying to extort $1 000
Club For Growth tried to extort $1 000
With millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment my numbers continue to go up. Can anyone explain this?
Lyin' Ted Cruz lost all five races on Tuesday-and he was just given the jinx - a Lindsey Graham endorsement. Also backed Jeb. Lindsey got 0!
Join us in Salt Lake City Utah- tonight!
Hillary Clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem!
Stuart Stevens the failed campaign manager of Mitt Romney's historic loss
Thank you Missouri! #Trump2016 
Wow just won Missouri!
Thank you to the Governor of Florida Rick Scott

Thank you Florida! #SuperTuesday
Thank you Northern Mariana Islands!#SuperTuesday #Trump2016
Can't watch Crazy Megyn anymore. Talks about me at 43% but never mentions that there are four people in race. With two people big &amp; over!
Word is that despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads
A lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in Florida? Hope this is false.
I will bring our jobs back to the U.S. and keep our companies from leaving. Nobody else can do it. Our economy will sing again.
In presidential voting so far John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him
Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico now losing Ford (and many others). Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now!
Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate until I put him down.
#VoteTrump #SuperTuesday
North Carolina lost 300 000 manufacturing jobs and Ohio lost 400
Just in big news- I have been declared the winner of the CNMI Rep Caucus with 72.8% of the vote! Thank you! #SuperTuesday #VoteTrump
Don't reward Mitt Romney who let us all down in the last presidential race
Please remember I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich
I will bring our jobs back to America fix our military and take care of our vets
Rubio is weak on illegal immigration with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Kasich voted for NAFTA a disaster for Ohio
Sadly this kind of stuff even happened to Ronald Reagan. There is nothing nice about it! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
THANK YOU - Youngstown Ohio! I love you! Get out &amp; #VoteTrump tomorrow. #Trump2016 
Kasich has helped decimate the coal and steel industries in Ohio. I will bring them back! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Gov Kasich voted for NAFTA which devastated Ohio and is now pushing TPP hard- bad for American workers!
Leaving the great people of North Carolina. Amazing event. Heading to Tampa now! #VoteTrump
Look forward to being in Tampa this afternoon. Wonderful crowds. Thank you Florida!
We don't have a country- if we don't have borders. #VoteTrump
LYIN' TED 
Because Gov. Kasich cannot run in the state of Pennsylvania-he cannot win the nomination- &amp; should not be allowed to compete in Ohio on Tue.
Carly Fiorina- I agree! Ted Cruz is just another politician. All talk- no action!
Thank you Kevin. With unification of the party Republican wins will be massive!
Ohio Gov.Kasich voted for NAFTA from which Ohio has never recovered. Now he wants TPP
Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie or my supporters will go to yours!
Wow Kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of Pennsylvania
USSS did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. He has ties to ISIS. Should be in jail! ?ssr=true
Do the people of Ohio know that John Kasich is STRONGLY in favor of Common Core! In other words education of your children from D.C. No way
#EndCommonCore #Trump2016
Just finished my second speech. 20K in Dayton &amp; 25K in Cleveland- perfectly behaved crowd. Thanks- I love you Ohio! 
It is Clinton and Sanders people who disrupted my rally in Chicago - and then they say I must talk to my people. Phony politicians!
The last person that Hillary or Bernie want to run against is Donald Trump --- and that is fact!
We are asking law enforcement to check for dishonest early voting in Florida- on behalf of little Marco Rubio.
Word is-early voting in FL is very dishonest. Little Marco his State Chairman
The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled!
Thank you Dayton Ohio! 20
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
On my way to Dayton Ohio. Will be there soon!
The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled. Will be great - love you Ohio!
Ohio had the biggest budget increase in the U.S. If it were not for striking oil they would be bust! Governor Kasich in favor of TPP fraud!
Absentee Governor Kasich voted for NAFTA and NAFTA devastated Ohio - a disaster from which it never recovered. Kasich is good for Mexico!
The organized group of people many of them thugs

The Club for Growth is a very dishonest group. They represent conservative values terribly &amp; are bad for America. 
People forget it was Club for Growth that asked me for $1 million. I said no &amp; they went negative. Extortion! 
Ted Cruz Was For Welcoming Syrian Refugees Before He Was Against It
I employ many people in Hawaii at my great hotel in Honolulu. I’ll be there very soon. Vote for me Hawaii!

Will be in Orlando Florida
Wow big lines in Kansas.
For all of today's voters please remember that I am the only candidate that is self funding my campaign I am not bought and paid for!

U.S. Senator Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) issued the following statement today regarding the 2016 presidential election: 
Thank you Macomb County Michigan! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
The phony lawsuit against Trump U could have been easily settled by me but I want to go to court. 98% approval rating by students. Easy win
Why did Mitt Romney BEG me for my endorsement four years ago?
I am the only one who can beat Hillary Clinton. I am not a Mitt Romney who doesn't know how to win. Hillary wants no part of Trump
Why would the great people of Florida vote for a guy who as a Senator
I have brought millions of people into the Republican Party while the Dems are going down. Establishment wants to kill this movement!
Failed candidate Mitt Romney who ran one of the worst races in presidential history
Looks like two-time failed candidate Mitt Romney is going to be telling Republicans how to get elected. Not a good messenger!
Millions of dollars being spent on false TV ads by special interest groups who own Rubio &amp; Cruz.When you see them think of your puppet POLS
Because of me the Republican Party has taken in millions of new voters
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
I would love to see the Republican party and everyone get together- and unify.
Just another desperate move by the man who should have easily beaten Barrack Obama. (2/2)
Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney is having a news conference tomorrow to criticize me. (1/2)
I am going to repeal and replace ObamaCare! Read more about my positions on healthcare reform here: 
Marco Rubio lost big last night. I even beat him in Virginia where he spent so much time and money. Now his bosses are desperate and angry!
Why would anyone in Florida vote for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. Check out his credit card scam his house sale &amp; his no show voting!
The special interests and people who control our politicians (puppets) are spending $25 million on misleading and fraudulent T.V. ads on me.

Phylis Schlafly: 'Marco Rubio Betrayed Us All' 
Little Marco Rubio treated America's ICE officers like absolute trash in order to pass Obama's amnesty. 
Little Marco Rubio gave amnesty to criminal aliens guilty of sex offenses. DISGRACE! 
Little Marco Rubio is just another Washington D.C. politician that is all talk and no action. #RobotRubio 
Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio is polling very poorly in Florida. The people can't stand him for missing so many votes - poor work ethic!
Little Marco Rubio the lightweight no show Senator from Florida is just another Washington politician. 
Mitt Romney didn't show his tax return until SEPTEMBER 21 2012
As I stated at the press conference on Friday regarding David Duke- I disavow. 
Why would the people of Texas support Ted Cruz when he has accomplished absolutely nothing for them. He is another all talk no action pol!
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
Little Marco Rubio the lightweight no show Senator from Florida
Making a big speech in Alabama today. So many people we had to move to a football stadium! Come and join us!
I am the only Republican who will get large numbers of Dems and Indies (crossover). I will also get states that no other Republican can get.
While Hillary and I both won South Carolina by big margins Repubs got far more votes with a massive increase from past cycles.GROWING PARTY
The Republican Establishment has been pushing for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio to say anything to hit Trump.I signed the pledge-careful
While I hear the Koch brothers are in big financial trouble (oil) word is they have chosen little Marco Rubio
Big day in Texas tomorrow! Having a rally in Fort Worth. Tremendous crowd. Will be exciting! #Trump2016 
All the online polls have me winning the debate. I really enjoyed the evening. Not easy but good. 
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
Thank you! #GOPDebate Polls
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 
Thank you! WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #Trump2016 
THANK YOU!
FMR PRES of Mexico Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall. He must apologize! If I did that there would be a uproar!
Early on Ted Cruz said that if he didn't win South Carolina it's over. He didn't win- and lost to me in a landslide!
Thank you Illinois! #Trump2016 
Join me in Oklahoma tomorrow night!
LETS MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Signing a recent tax return- isn't this ridiculous? 
Just for your info tax returns have 0 to do w/ someone’s net worth. I have already filed my financial statements w/ FEC. They are great!
Mitt Romney who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics
Great new poll. Thank you Texas! #VoteTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
Ted Cruz is lying again. Polls are showing that I do beat Hillary Clinton head to head. Check out Poll snd Q Poll.
Texas Georgia &amp; many more VOTE EARLY! This is a movement!
When Ted Cruz quits the race and the field begins to clear I will get most of his votes - no problem!
Why would Texans vote for liar Ted Cruz when he was born in Canada lived there for 4 years-and remained a Canadian citizen until recently
When Mitt Romney asked me for my endorsement last time around he was so awkward and goofy that we all should have known he could not win!
I am growing the Republican Party tremendously - just look at the numbers way up! Democrats numbers are significantly down from years past.
The reason that Ted Cruz lost the Evangelicals in S.C. is because he is a world class LIAR and Evangelicals do not like liars!
I am in Las Vegas at the best hotel (by far)
A number of months ago I was not expected to win South Carolina
THANK YOU Atlanta Georgia! Leaving for Nevada now. Lets MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN! 
Thank you South Carolina! 
A quote was read from a parody account last night on MSNBC re: Jeb. 
I will be live on all of the major morning talk shows. Enjoy!
South Carolina voters have the future of our country in their hands. Vote now (today) and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Remember that Marco Rubio is very weak on illegal immigration. South Carolina needs strength as illegals and Syrians pour in. Don't allow it
I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go!
I am the only candidate (in many years) who is self-funding his campaign. Lobbyists and $ interests totally control all other candidates!
Lying #Ted Cruz just (on election day) came out with a sneak and sleazy Robocall. He holds up the Bible but in fact is a true lowlife pol!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Just finished two major speeches in South Carolina. Big crowds great people. Going for a third now!
Boycott all Apple products until such time as Apple gives cellphone info to authorities regarding radical Islamic terrorist couple from Cal
I have built so many great &amp; complicated projects– creating tens of thousands of jobs-video: 
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
Remember Cruz and Bush gave us Roberts who upheld #ObamaCare twice! I am the only one who will #MAKEAMERICAGREATAGAIN!
I’m self-funding and I am going to take care of the people – not the special interests and insurance companies like the other candidates.
I will replace it with private plans health savings accounts
I was referring to a backstop for pre-existing conditions. I will eliminate the law in its entirety
I was asked about healthcare by Anderson Cooper &amp; have been consistent- I will repeal all of #ObamaCare including the mandate
Thank you South Carolina! Everyone get out and vote tomorrow! We will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 
We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE &amp; GREAT AGAIN! #Trump2016 #VoteTrumpSC
Join us Saturday night- for the South Carolina Primary Watch Party!
Join us tomorrow night in Charleston South Carolina! #SCPrimary #Trump2016

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
Thank you America! #Trump2016
New CBS National Poll just out - massive lead for Trump. The Wall Street Journal/NBC Poll is a total joke. No wonder WSJ is doing so badly!
I love being in South Carolina. We are leading big in all of the State polls - Saturday is a BIG day. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The just out USA Today National Poll where I lead by big numbers
Amazing that while I lead by big numbers in the new Q and and USA Today polls the the press only wants to report on the phony WSJ/NBC poll.
Join us tomorrow in Kiawah South Carolina! #SCPrimary #VoteTrumpSC
THANK YOU AMERICA!
Thank you Nevada! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
Jeb Bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses. He wants to look cool but it's far too late. 1% in Nevada!
Just out Nevada poll shows Jeb Bush at 1% he should take his dumb mouthpiece
I will beat Hillary easily but Lindsey Graham says I won't
Interesting how President Obama so haltingly said I would never be president - This from perhaps the worst president in U.S. history!
Thank you South Carolina! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
Thank you to the 2 500+ in North Augusta
#TeamTrump is thinking of Captain Andrew Maitner. A true American hero. #MaitnerStrong 
Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
New PPP Poll just out - Trump up big Cruz
Spent the full day at meetings and a major rally yesterday in South Carolina. Great people and spirit. Today will be more of the same.
New South Carolina poll from PPP. Thank you! #VoteTrumpSC 
What a night! 10 000 amazing supporters in Greenville
Thank you for your continued support!
RESPONSE TO THE LIES OF SENATOR CRUZ: 
JEB is a hypocrite! Used massive private Eminent Domain --- Just another clueless politician!
Jeb used Eminent Domain &amp; took advantage of a disabled vet in the process. (2/2)
I'd like to call JEB a liar but the truth is he has no clue &amp; never revealed that he used Eminent Domain- when criticizing me! (1/2)
Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!) is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center
I will be in South Carolina all week. Saturday is BIG BIG
Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates Hillary would destroy them. Ted may not be eligible to run - born in Canada
Funny that Jeb(!) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.Then mommy now brother!
Ted Cruz along with Jeb Bush
Wow in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties! Thank you!
Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists &amp; special interests - the bosses!
Loved the debate last night and almost everyone said I won
Thank you for your support! TOGETHER we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I will be on Face the Nation with John Dickerson on CBS this morning. Enjoy!
This shows what a complete &amp; total liar Ted Cruz is- he said he wouldn't have nominated John Roberts. Really? 
Even though every poll Time
A very big thank you to Bill Donohue head of The Catholic League
Totally unauthorized do not pay. I am self funding my campaign! Notice has just been withdrawn. #Trump2016
The RNC which is probably not on my side
Now an additional 600-700 jobs in America (2 000) being eliminated for move to Mexico- via Hartford Courant. 
I am the only one who can fix this. Very sad. Will not happen under my watch! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Just got back from Tampa. It was an amazing evening with an even more amazing crowd - fantastic people! Will be in South Carolina tomorrow.
11 000 inside venue tonight in Tampa! Broke record set by Elton John in 1988 w/out musical instruments! Another 5
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 
Heading to Baton Rouge Louisiana for a speech. Expecting a very large crowd! See you soon. #Trump2016
We are getting reports from many voters that the Cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest pushpolls on me. We are watching!
Jeb failed as Jeb! He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq). Spent $120 million.Weak-no chance!
He (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Remember it was the Republican Party
Jeb Bush spent more than $40 000
I have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core. Get rid of Common Core--- keep education local!
THANK YOU- Clemson South Carolina! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #SCPrimary 
Come join us at the Verizon Wireless Center- Manchester New Hampshire on 2/8! Register now: 
I love New Hampshire - will be an exciting evening!
Join me tomorrow in Plymouth New Hampshire! #FITN #NHPrimary
The New Hampshire drug epidemic must stop. If elected POTUS- I will create borders &amp; the drugs will stop pouring in. 
Wow Jeb Bush
Border agent: We might as well abolish our immigration laws altogether
I said this was happening long ago- I will stop this immediately!
It never ends! 
I told you so. Our country totally lost control of illegal immigration even with criminals.
10 000 people in South Carolina
Taking a helicopter to New Hampshire boarding now. Amazing activity planned. New UMASS poll
Politicians are trying to chip away at the 2nd Amendment. I won’t let them take away our guns! #Trump2016
This is the Cruz voter violation certificate sent to everyone a misdemeanor at minimum. 
Sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn't want to run against me. He would be so easy to beat!
THANK YOU to everyone in Little Rock Arkansas tonight! A record crowd of 12K. #Trump2016
Stop the assault on American values. Stand w/ Trump to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
Thank you New Hampshire! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #FITN 
Dr. Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for deceit and dirty tricks and lies.
Cruz just lied again- I am and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace!
The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!
This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #CruzFraud 
Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.
And finally Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and choice - a total lie!
The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud
Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.
Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!
On my way to New Hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd!
overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his Howard Dean moment!
I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign the only one. I will keep doing
I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire. Big crowd
The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history!
Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz &amp; Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor
My experience in Iowa was a great one. I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place. Nice
It all begins today - WE WILL FINALLY TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Join us! #CaucusForTrump
So nice to get an endorsement from the founder and owner of Pizza Ranch in Iowa! A great guy and great places! #CaucusForTrump
It is time to take back our country- and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
If I would have done the last debate a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also
By not doing the failed poorly rated debate
Wow just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me
Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans scam!
Ted Cruz is totally unelectable if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN!
I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State!
The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters in violation. They are now under investigation. Bad!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
#IACaucus #CaucusForTrump
I want to thank evangelical Christians for the warm embrace I've received on the campaign trail. Video: 
I will be in Iowa all day and until Tuesday morning. Finally after all these years of watching stupidity
Hillary Clinton is a major national security risk. Not presidential material!
THANK YOU to all of the incredible volunteers behind the scenes in Iowa! #CaucusForTrump 
Looking forward to a great weekend in Iowa! #IACaucus #CaucusForTrump
The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton. At a minimum how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?
Thank you for all of your support Iowa!
They say that if I participated in last night’s Fox debate they would have had 12 million more &amp; would have broken the all time record.
Thank you America! #Trump2016
Join me tomorrow in Dubuque Iowa! #IACaucus #Trump2016
Thank you- Nashua New Hampshire!
The debate tonight will be a total disaster - low ratings with advertisers and advertising rates dropping like a rock. I hate to see this.
#Trump2016 #IACaucus Finder:
On Greta 87% of the people said they would not watch the debate if I'm not in it. Wow- what an honor!
FOX debate advertising rates falling like a rock! Tune into my special event for the Veterans at 9pm EST!
Thank you- Lexington South Carolina!
It was the childishly written &amp; taunting PR statement by Fox that made me not do the debate more so than lightweight reporter
I am self funding my campaign so I do not owe anything to lobbyists &amp; special interests. 
Even though I beat him in the first six debates especially the last one
Just got to listen to Rush Limbaugh - the guy is fantastic!
I refuse to call Megyn Kelly a bimbo because that would not be politically correct. Instead I will only call her a lightweight reporter!
CBS's FACE THE NATION - Posts Largest Audience Since 2001

Cruz lies are almost as bad as Jeb's. These politicians will do anything to stay at the trough!
Cruz going down fast in recent polls- dropping like a rock. Lies never work!
Ted Cruz is a nervous wreck. He is making reckless charges not caring for the truth! His poll #'s are way down!
Find out where to #VoteTrump on caucus night in Iowa on 2/1/16!
Join us in Iowa tomorrow! #IACaucus #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
I want to win for the people of this great country. The only people I will owe are the voters. #Trump2016
IPSOS/REUTERS POLL
It's time for Ted Cruz to either settle his problem with the FACT that he was born in Canada and was a citizen of Canada or get out of race
Fox News Poll
New Fox News Poll
I will make our Military so big powerful &amp; strong that no one will mess with us. #Trump2016 
Love making correct predictions. National Review is over.
Serious doubt in Illinois as to whether or not Cruz can run for President. First of many challenges. 
Just left a great event in Pella. Going to church tomorrow in Muscatine Iowa.
Heading now to Pella Iowa. Big crowd! Remember
For the great people of Iowa find your #IACaucus location at . So important to vote! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Just left Sioux Center Iowa. My speech was very well received. Truly great people! Packed house- overflow!
Heading to Sioux County Iowa
Ted Cruz poll numbers are down big. Because he was born in Canada and was until recently
I am in Iowa watching all of these phony T.V. ads by the other candidates. All bull politicians are all talk and no action-it won't happen!
I will be the greatest job-producing president in American history. #Trump2016 #VoteTrump
I am in Iowa. Will be making two speeches today. Good luck to all of the great folks on the East coast. Enjoy the beauty of the storm!
A wonderful article by a writer who truly gets it. I am for the people and the people are for me. #Trump2016
Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. &amp; is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi low interest loans. No legal disclosure &amp; never sold off assets.
Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS. He could be Canadian Prime Minister.
Cruz says I supported TARP which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs
Just watched Jeb's ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him. Jeb --- mom can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.
Ted Cruz went down big in just released Reuters poll - what's going on? Is it Goldman Sachs/Citi loans or Canada?
Rush Limbaugh is great tells it as he sees it---really honorable guy! Thanks Rush! #Trump2016
The tax scam Washington Post does among the most inaccurate stories of all. Really dishonest reporting.
Just received the new Fox poll.
Wow! New National Zogby Poll just out:.TRUMP 45. CRUZ 13. RUBIO 8. Big numbers.
Leaving Nevada now for Iowa. Things are looking good - great new polls!
New National GOP Zogby Poll
Highly respected Constitutional law professor Mary Brigid McManamon has just stated Ted Cruz is not eligible to be President. Big problem
Ted Cruz complains about my views on eminent domain but without it we wouldn't have roads
The late great
Very few people read the National Review because it only knows how to criticize but not how to lead.
National Review is a failing publication that has lost it's way. It's circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low. Sad!
Thank you Iowa! #FITN #IACaucus
#Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
Thank you New Hampshire!
Thank you! #Trump2016 
Thank you Iowa! #Trump2016 
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
I don't think Ted Cruz can even run for President until he can assure Republican voters that being born in Canada is not a problem. Doubt!
Ted Cruz is falling in the polls. He is nervous. People are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks!
I loved being at Liberty University today! Record setting crowd unbelievable people! Thank you Jerry and Becki! 
We launched a new series of #Trump2016 videos via Facebook. A new topic everyday! Watch: 
Leaving for Liberty University. I'll be speaking today in front of a record crowd. #Trump2016
Just a reminder that Ted Cruz supported liberal Justice John Roberts who gave us #Obamacare. 
United States looks more and more like a paper tiger. Won't be that way if I win!
Iran humiliated the United States with the capture of our 10 sailors. Horrible pictures &amp; images. We are weak. I will NOT forget!
THANK YOU! #VoteTrump
Thank you! #VoteTrump
My nomination would increase voter turnout. #VoteTrump
Sadly there is no way that Ted Cruz can continue running in the Republican Primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility. Dems will sue!
Thank you for your support last night Iowa! #VoteTrump #Trump2016 #IACaucus #FITN #IAPolitics 
Iran toys with U.S. days before we pay them ridiculously
Numerous polls have me beating Hillary Clinton. In a race with her voter turnout will be the highest in U.S. history-I get most new voters!
The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time. New leadership fast!
The #SOTU speech is really boring slow
The Iran deal is terrible. Why didn't we get the uranium stockpile - it was sent to Russia. #SOTU
New CBS poll. #Trump2016
Another new Iowa poll just released. Thank you! #IACaucus #FITN 
Such a serious problem for Ted &amp; the GOP. Great doubt Dems will sue! Let's all work together to solve this problem. 
now. Will be great--I love the people of Iowa!
THANK YOU! #Trump2016 
The Tonight Show begins in 5 minutes. Enjoy!

Thank you #Biloxi #Mississippi! Remember this night &amp; spread the word to get out &amp; #VoteTrump2016! 
Just arrived in Mississippi for the rally. Word is that the crowd is overflowing and massive. Will be an amazing evening!
Heading to Biloxi Mississippi. Massive crowds expected. Thank you for your support! #VoteTrump2016 
Remember I am self-funding my campaign
When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates beware - the candidates are mere puppets $$$$!
I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women!
Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. Jeb Bush is a low energy individual but Hillary is not much better!
Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant!
Massive crowds expected in Mississippi tomorrow night. Look forward to it! 2015 IN PHOTOS: 
#VoteTrump2016 &amp; together we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! THANK YOU for your support! 
Thank you so much to for naming me the 2015 Man of the Year. This is indeed a great honor for me!
The person that Hillary Clinton least wants to run against is by far
Well the year has officially begun. I have many stops planned and will be working very hard to win so that we can turn our country around!
Happy New Year from #MarALago! Thank you to my great family for all of their support. 
#HappyNewYearAmerica! 
HAPPY NEW YEAR &amp; THANK YOU!

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
show my answer to his statement in the debate?
show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate?
is now doing ads against me where he tries to look like a tough guy.
Video from Michigan last night. After asking for months the media panned their cameras! 
THANK YOU America!
Thank you - Michigan!
Thank you - New Hampshire!
THANK YOU Grand Rapids Michigan! Time to end political correctness &amp; secure our homeland! 
Getting ready to leave for Michigan - will be an amazing evening! See you there.
Do you think that Hillary Clinton will apologize to me for the lie she told about the video of me being used by ISIS. There is no video.
A suicide bomber has just killed U.S. troops in Afghanistan. When will our leaders get tough and smart. We are being led to slaughter!
It was really strange when Hillary was missing from the podium last night. Not very presidential!
Hillary Clinton spokesperson admitted that their was no ISIS video of me. Therefore Hillary LIED at the debate last night. SAD!
We need a #POTUS with great strength &amp; stamina. Hillary does not have that.
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
Thank you Cedar Rapids Iowa!
President Obama spends so much time speaking of the so-called Carbon footprint and yet he flies all the way to Hawaii on a massive old 747.
See Sanders backed Hillary on E-mails at the debate
Another new post-debate poll.
Thank you for all of your support! Most importantly - we need to get everyone out to VOTE! #VoteTrump2016 
The last thing our country needs is another BUSH! Dumb as a rock!

As I have been saying. Only the beginning: ISIS Suspects Arrested in Turkey 150 European Passports Seized. 
New Reuters poll - thank you!

There is no question who will handle the threat of terrorism best as #POTUS. #Trump2016 
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
Clear winner of the #GOPDebate. Thank you for your support!
Hillary Clinton is weak and ineffective - no strength no stamina.
Highly respected PUBLIC POLICY POLLING (PPP) just announced that I am number one in IOWA. Thank you!

People have got to stop working to be so politically correct and focus all of their energy on finding solutions to very complex problems!
I was disappointed that Ted Cruz would speak behind my back get caught
Many think that the Championship Course at Turnberry home of The Duel In The Sun

I will be on CNN's - State of the Union tomorrow morning at 9amE.

Thank you General. #Trump2016 
A great afternoon. Thank you South Carolina! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
Reports say #ISIS now has a passport machine to have its believers infiltrate our country. I told you so. 
John Podesta says nominee will be Cruz b/c last person Hillary wants to face is Trump! Use your head folks! 46-41! 
Thank you! #Trump2016
Just got back from Iowa great people!
I had a great time in Des Moines Iowa tonight! Thank you for all of the support. #Trump2016 
Thank you! We are at 35% in new Reuters poll with #2 coming in at 12%. Time to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!#Trump2016 
I will not let you down!
Tom Ridge should be focused on trying to bring the party together rather than ripping it apart w/ your faulty thought process. I will win!
Never get good #'s from failing Des Moines Register/Bloomberg. I think something's going on w/them. Up 13 in IA according to respected CNN.
Great news in Georgia! The just out Landmark poll shows me in first with 43%! Wow. 
Our spectacular ballroom under construction at the great Turnberry resort in Scotland. 
Great evening last night in New Hampshire. Got the endorsement from the New England Police Union - big territory great people! Thank you.
Respected Morning Consult poll just out. I lead all Republicans and beat Hillary head to head by a wide margin- 45 to 40!
In Britain more Muslims join ISIS than join the British army.
An honor to be endorsed by the New England Police Benevolent Association. Thank you! 
Hillary Clinton does not have the STRENGTH or STAMINA to be President. We need strong and super smart for our next leader - or trouble!
The last person corrupt Hillary Clinton wants to run against is Donald J. Trump. I'll end up beating her in every state. New Fox Poll-Trump!
Wow what a day. So many foolish people that refuse to acknowledge the tremendous danger and uncertainty of certain people coming into U.S.
Our country is facing a major threat from radical Islamic terrorism. We better get very smart and very tough
Prior to the end of the year I will be traveling to Israel. I am very much looking forward to it.
Great new poll from NH. Thank you! We need to keep this country safe! #Trump2016 
A new poll indicates that 68% of my supporters would vote for me if I departed the GOP &amp; ran as an independent. 
Thank you for the support South Carolina! #USSYorktown
Today we honor the fallen at #PearlHarbor 74 years ago today. If you see a vet today
Well Obama refused to say (he just can't say it)
Should have gone after the oil years ago (like I have been saying).
Wish Obama would say ISIS like almost everyone else
Is that all there is? We need a new President - FAST!
Hope he won't spend too much time ripping apart the 2nd. Amendment!
The podium in the Oval Office looks odd! Not good but the words will be the key.
Hillary won't call out radical Islam! She will be soundly defeated.
I will be re-tweeting some of your better most imaginative and hopefully insightful tweets. Make them good (great)! Important stuff.
BIG NIGHT ON TWITTER TONIGHT. I WILL BE LIVE TWEETING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SPEECH AT 7:50 P.M. ( EASTERN). MUST TALK RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM!
May the Festival of Lights bring our Jewish friends from around the world health &amp; happiness! Happy Hanukkah!

California shooting looks very bad. Good luck to law enforcement and God bless. This is when our police are so appreciated!

Just arrived in New Hampshire. Another packed venue! Will be fun.
You would think a paper like the Washington Post would be fair and objective. For the record almost all polls showed I won all debates.

What is Obama thinking? 
Look at the editorial I was just sent from the NY Post on 9/14/01 - 3 days after collapse of WTC. Any apologies? 
is so proud of pop!
A great night in Macon Georgia! Thank you for all of the support. Together
Meeting with African American Pastors at Trump Tower was amazing. Wonderful news conference followed. Now off to Georgia for big speech!
We better be vigilant careful
is concerned w/ my high poll #'s. More concerned are Dems—I beat Hillary heads up!
How is Chris Christie running the state of NJ which is deeply troubled
Wow the MSM is really going after me. 12
After my meeting with the pastors it's off to Georgia for a big rally - many thousands of great people will be there
Will be meeting on Monday at Trump Tower with a large group of African American Pastors. Many I know-wonderful people! Not a press event.
Sarasota was an unbelievable success. We expected 5 000
We boarded the helicopter for Sarasota earlier &amp; will be landing soon! See you there. #Trump2016 
Happy Thanksgiving to all. Have a great day and look forward to the future. We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

A wonderful evening in South Carolina - big crowd amazing energy!
What is Frank VanderSloot getting for agreeing to back Marco Rubio? Last victim was Mitt Romney - see how that turned out.
Thank you to all law enforcement agencies for a fabulous job!
Thank you for a great afternoon Birmingham Alabama! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
Thank you John Nolte for
Rumor has it - Pataki Kasich
A woman who got fired after two days of working with Scott Walker - a wacko - now trying to raise funds to fight me.
Heading to Birmingham Alabama
To show you how politicians act Bobby Jindal spent $1
We're stuck with the worst mayor in the United States. Too bad but New York City will survive!
People are really liking my new book Crippled America. Check it out!
Just got back from South Carolina. Going to Alabama tomorrow!
Can you believe the worst Mayor in the U.S. &amp; probably the worst Mayor in the history of #NYC
Thank you for a great afternoon South Carolina! See you next Tuesday! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
I didn't suggest a database-a reporter did. We must defeat Islamic terrorism &amp; have surveillance including a watch list
Going to South Carolina now great place
The media must denigrate ISIS at all levels or youth will continue to be drawn to it. These are low level degenerates NOT masterminds!
The media must immediately stop calling ISIS leaders MASTERMINDS. Call them instead thugs and losers. Young people must not go into ISIS!
A wonderful afternoon in Iowa! Great people! Heading now to Florida - tomorrow South Carolina! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
A great evening in Iowa! Thank you Des Moines Area Community College for a great forum! #Trump2016 #IAForums 
John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed bringing down the world and ruining people's lives. A total failure!
Once John Kasich announced he was running for president and opened his mouth
John Kasich fell right into President Obama’s trap on ObamaCare and the people of Ohio are suffering for it. Shame!
Doesn’t help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else - he’s almost last.
I loved beating John Kasich in the debates but it was easy—he came in dead last!
Kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down. People from NH are smart!
Watch Kasich squirm --- if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun!
I want to do negative ads on John Kasich but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don’t want to waste my money.
John Kasich despite being Governor of Ohio
John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image not negative ads on me.
Governor Kasich whose failed campaign &amp; debating skills have brought him way down in the polls
Thank you Worcester Massachusetts!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
Just the beginning &amp; it is going to get worse. Rates &amp; deductibles are so high nobody is going to be able to use it. 
I told you! Premiums are soaring! #RepealObamacare #Trump2016
Thank you for your support! Together we can #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! #Trump2016 
The POLICE in Paris did a fantastic job. Very brave - not easy!
Eight Syrians were just caught on the southern border trying to get into the U.S. ISIS maybe? I told you so. WE NEED A BIG &amp; BEAUTIFUL WALL!
What is our President doing? 
Tom Brady just did it again. He is not only a great guy he is
President Obama just told President Putin how important the Russian air strikes against ISIS have been. I TOLD YOU SO!
We need strong tough and brilliant leadership now more than ever! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I had a great time in Texas yesterday. A tremendous crowd of wonderful and enthusiastic people. Will be back soon!
When will President Obama issue the words RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM? He can't say it and unless he will
Great news out of New Hampshire! DonaldTrump is pulling away from the pack w/ 2nd is 17% behind him! #Trump2016 
We need much tougher much smarter leadership - and we need it NOW!
President Obama said ISIL continues to shrink in an interview just hours before the horrible attack in Paris. He is just so bad! CHANGE.
My prayers are with the victims and hostages in the horrible Paris attacks. May God be with you all.
They laughed at me when I said to bomb the ISIS controlled oil fields. Now they are not laughing and doing what I said. #Trump2016
Great honor to be inducted into the NJ Boxing Hall of Fame last night. Thank you! Timing could not have been better! 
I also told Gov. Kasich to “let Jeb talk
Loved doing the debate...won Drudge and all on-line polls! Amazing evening moderators did an outstanding job.
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
Marco Rubio is totally weak on illegal immigration &amp; in favor of easy amnesty. A lightweight choker - bad for #USA!
Marco Rubio couldn't even respond properly to President Obama's State of the Union Speech without pouring sweat &amp; chugging water. He choked!
Marco Rubio is a total lightweight who I wouldn’t hire to run one of my smaller companies - a highly overrated politician!
A great evening in Springfield Illinois. Thank you for all of the support! #Trump2016 
and works for Bush—a total conflict of interest. 
Amazing evening at Saturday Night Live!
I am at the Saturday Night Live Studio - electricity all over the place. We will be doing a tweeting skit so stay tuned!
Carson now admits his friend named Bob who he tried to stab (Bob was saved by his belt buckle!)
With Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer stab a friend and Pyramids built for grain storage - don't people get it?
Florida Ethics Commission Advocate comes down hard on Rubio. So do two people who worked with him. Said he used the wrong credit card! Sure.
The Carson story is either a total fabrication or if true
Rubio lied about my meeting w/ Hispanic activists. I didn’t change my opinion but treated them w/ respect. Shame!
Just landed in New Hampshire - a very exciting morning planned!
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
Join me today Nov 3rd
at 12pm in #TrumpTowerNY. I’ll be signing copies of my new book CRIPPLED AMERICA. Don’t miss it!
Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's Mr. Amnesty
Gov. John Kasich has really failed on the campaign trail. I thought he would have been far more talented. He is just wasting time &amp; money!
I was #1 on Twitter -- and so positive. Thank you! 
Drudge Poll on who won the 3rd #GOPDebate. Thank you! 
Thank you Jonathan. Greatly appreciated! 
After a great evening and packed auditorium in Iowa I am now in Colorado looking forward to what I am sure will be a very unfair debate!
I am leaving for Sioux City Iowa - great event (rally).
Do you think I will get credit for keeping Ford in U.S. Who cares my supporters know the truth. Think what can be done as president!
Word is that Ford Motor because of my constant badgering at packed events
Ben Carson has never created a job in his life (well maybe a nurse). I have created tens of thousands of jobs
While Jeb Bush is cutting staff and salaries after having paid ridiculous amounts of money
Expecting a great crowd of amazing people. Questions will be live! #TrumpToday
Just finished speaking in Jacksonville Florida. Incredible crowd
Leaving for Jacksonville now. See you there! Miami was great.
Massive crowds already forming in Jacksonville - will be and incredible day - 12 noon! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tonight's official count--7 943. An all time record for the Anderson Civic Center in SC! Thanks! #Trump2016 
Jeb is fighting to defend a catastrophic event. I am fighting to make sure it doesn't happen again.Jeb is too soft-we need tougher &amp; sharper

Will be going to Richmond Virginia today. Big crowd! See you there.
Check out OAN and compare to what you are watching now!
Notice that illegal immigrants will be given ObamaCare and free college tuition but nothing has been mentioned about our VETERANS #DemDebate
Sanders said only black lives matter - wow! Hillary did not answer question!
Sorry there is no STAR on the stage tonight!
Good move by Bernie S.
The hardest thing Clinton has to do is defend her bad decision making including Iraq vote e-mails etc.
All are very scripted and rehearsed two (at least) should not be on the stage.
Who is winning the debate so far (just last name)? #DemDebate
O'Malley as former Mayor of Baltimore
Can anyone imagine Chafee as president? No way.
Should be interesting but too bad the three guys at«1% will be taking up so much time - but who knows maybe a star will be born (unlikely)
Leaving soon after a great time in New Hampshire a truly special place!
Just got back from Georgia. The crowds and love for U.S. was so amazing! We all had a great day together - will be back soon!

Paul Ryan is far from my first choice but a very nice guy. The Republicans should go for tough and (very) smart this time - no games!
Washington (D.C.) is such a mess - nothing works! I will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It's not going to happen with anyone else.
Just arrived in Las Vegas for a packed house speech tomorrow. Big poll results today Leading big everywhere. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Don't ever forget we will
So so
Just leaving Nashville Tennessee. Had a great time with a fabulous crowd of people! Love Nashville -- back soon! 
Rubio was very disloyal to Bush his mentor
Bush and Rubio are finally attacking each other as I knew they would

Will be in Nashville Tennessee
I was so looking forward to being in Virginia Beach Virginia
My warmest condolences to the families of the horrible Roseburg Oregon
Just got back from New Hampshire. Great crowd great people! Will be back soon!

Marco Rubio is a member of the Gang Of Eight or very weak on stopping illegal immigration. Only changed when poll numbers crashed.
An updated POLL tracker (with all polls thru the weekend) reveals I maintained a double digit lead at… 
Just left Oklahoma--- the most amazing crowd and people! What a night!
At the Old Post Office- 
I am now inspecting the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue - will be a great hotel. Soon off to the Oklahoma State Fair!

We are going to WIN and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN maybe better than ever before!
I am attracting the biggest crowds by far
I have been leading big in all polls with two more today
There is no way that Carly Fiorina can become the Republican Nominee or win against the Dems. Boxer killed her for Senate in California!
A great night in Iowa! 
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
On my way to Iowa. Will be landing in Des Moines in two hours. See ya!
Christians need support in our country (and around the world) their religious liberty is at stake! Obama has been horrible
If I would have challenged the man the media would have accused me of interfering with that man's right of free speech. A no win situation!
If someone made a nasty or controversial statement about me to the president do you really think he would come to my rescue? No chance!
This is the first time in my life that I have caused controversy by NOT saying something.
Am I morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him? I don't think so!
had me winning in a landslide. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!

Little respected Club For Growth asked me for $1 000
Am now in L.A. Will be going to the U.S.S. IOWA at 5:30 P.M. to speak to our great VETERANS and other friends!
Loved Dallas and the tremendous crowd last night. Will be back!
Speech in Dallas went really well. Big and wonderful crowd. Just arrived in L.A. Big day tomorrow!
Unbelievable crowd in Dallas! 
Why is someone like George Pataki who did a terrible job as Governor of N.Y. and registers ZERO in the polls
Had a record crowd in Boone Iowa. A fantastic day--- we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

I had a great day in D.C. even though the subject was an unpleasant one the horrible Iran Nuke deal. Amazing crowd and enthusiasm!
See you in D.C. tomorrow at 1:00 P.M. at the Capitol to protest the horribly negotiated deal with Iran. Really sad!
Wow! Such nice words from Robert Redford on my running for President. Thank you Robert. 
Both Washington D.C. and DALLAS are turning out to be really big events. D.C. is protest of incompetent Iran deal and Dallas is big speech!
Remember I'll see you in D.C. at the Capitol Building on Wednesday at 1:00 o'clock. Then Dallas on Sept.14 at 6:00 P.M. American Air Center
I will be in Washington D.C. on Wednesday 1 P.M.
The Dallas event on September 14 at 6:00 P.M. at the American Airlines Center looks like it will be a giant success. Tickets are going FAST!
Our country needs a president with great leadership skills and vision not someone like Hillary or Barack
The phony Club For Growth which asked me in writing for $1
The hedge fund guys (gals) have to pay higher taxes ASAP. They are paying practically nothing. We must reduce taxes for the middle class!
By self-funding my campaign I am not controlled by my donors
Remember that I am self-funding my campaign. Hillary Jeb and the rest are spending special interest and lobbyist money.100% CONTROLLED
Hillary said such nasty things about me read directly off her teleprompter...but there was no emotion
Hillary Clinton made a speech today using the biggest teleprompter I have ever seen. In fact it wasn't even see through glass
Saudi Arabia was vehemently against the Iran nuclear deal. Then today they embraced it. What happened? What did we give them to endorse?
Very low ratings radio host Hugh Hewitt asked me about Suleiman Abu Bake al-Baghdad
The Dallas event in two weeks at the American Airlines Center
The deal with Iran will go down as one of the most incompetent ever made. The U.S. lost on virtually every point. We just don't win anymore!
When I intelligently turned down The Club For Growth crazy request for $1 000
The president of the pathetic Club For Growth came to my office in N.Y.C. and asked for a ridiculous $1 000
Leading in the Bloomberg Iowa poll. Also my favorability numbers went up at a record

The last thing we need is another Bush in the White House. Would be the same old thing (remember read my lips no more taxes). GREATNESS!
Jeb Bush has a photoshopped photo for an ad which gives him a black left hand and much different looking body. Jeb just can't get it right!
Jeb Bush is weak on illegal immigration in favor of common core
Now that I started my war on illegal immigration and securing the border most other candidates are finally speaking up. Just politicians!
It has just been confirmed by the City of Mobile Alabama

Leaving for Mobile Alabama
How crazy - 7.5% of all births in U.S. are to illegal immigrants over 300
Jeb Bush signed memo saying not to use the term anchor babies offensive. Now he wants to use it because I use it. Stay true to yourself!
Alabama will shine tomorrow. It will be a big and glorious day!
We are going to make our country so strong again so great again. No more ripping off the United States. We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

We must stop the crime and killing machine that is illegal immigration. Rampant problems will only get worse. Take back our country!
Truly weird Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky reminds me of a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain. He was terrible at DEBATE!
Again illegal immigrant is charged with the fatal bludgeoning of a wonderful and loved 64 year old woman. Get them out and build a WALL!
Wonderful Frank Gifford has just passed away at age 84. He was my friend and a truly great guy! Warmest condolences to family.
I just realized that if you listen to Carly Fiorina for more than ten minutes straight you develop a massive headache. She has zero chance!
Wow CNN just said that Donald Trump won the DEBATE
Re Megyn Kelly quote: you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes blood coming out of her wherever (NOSE). Just got on w/thought
So many politically correct fools in our country. We have to all get back to work and stop wasting time and energy on nonsense!

I really like the Koch Brothers (members of my P.B. Club) but I don't want their money or anything else from them. Cannot influence Trump!
be on TV discussing Trump?
I truly LOVE all of the millions of people who are sticking with me despite so many media lies. There is a great SILENT MAJORITY looming!

Arriving to check out the border. 
what a great place -- what great people.
Thoughts &amp; prayers with everyone in Lafayette Louisiana this evening.
Getting ready to lift off for Laredo. Will land at 1:OO P.M. Should be exciting and informative!
I hear a failing New York newspaper is going to publish one of my old cell phone numbers. So original - just one of many!
I'm glad President Obama followed my lead and lowered the flags half-staff. It's about time!
Rick Perry did an absolutely horrible job of securing the border. He should be ashamed of himself. Gov. Abbott has since been terrific.
Good luck to my new friends on your testimony in DC. You are amazing people doing something so important--- stopping illegal immigration!
Just got great national poll numbers - double digit lead! Thank you we will all MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I will be making some very big campaign stops next week - big crowds and tremendous energy! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
The Republican Party must get tougher and smarter and fast
The Veterans Administration is in shambles and our veterans are suffering greatly. John McCain has done nothing to help them but talk.
John McCain called thousands of people crazies when they came to seek help on illegal immigration last week in Phoenix. He owes apology!
for taking a tough &amp; bold stance at the border. Should have been done long ago by Perry.
I have a proven track record supporting our Veterans. Veterans deserve universal access to care. VA scandal proves politicians are inept.

I am now in Iowa getting ready to speak. People are always amazed to find out that I am Protestant (Presbyterian). GREAT.

....likewise billions of dollars gets brought into Mexico through the border. We get the killers
El Chapo and the Mexican drug cartels use the border unimpeded like it was a vacuum cleaner sucking drugs and death right into the U.S.
The U.S. will invite El Chapo the Mexican drug lord who just escaped prison
.....but that's what I've been saying. Very unfair treatment by the media!
Now that the Mexican drug lord escaped from prison everyone is saying that most of the cocaine etc. coming into the U.S. comes over border!
...Trump however
Can you envision Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton negotiating with 'El Chapo' the Mexican drug lord who escaped from prison? ....
Mexico's biggest drug lord escapes from jail. Unbelievable corruption and USA is paying the price. I told you so!
Phoenix Convention Center officials did not want to have thousands of people standing outside in the heat so they let them in. A GREAT day!

I will not be able to attend the Miss USA pageant tomorrow night because I am campaigning in Phoenix. Wishing all well!
Legal immigrants want border security. It is common sense. We must build a wall! Let's Make America Great Again!

As Governor of Texas Rick Perry could have done far more to secure the border - but that's O.K.
Make our borders strong and stop illegal immigration. Even President Obama agrees- 
Look what the President of NBC sent me recently about his stay in my Las Vegas hotel. Very loyal guy. 
My just filed lawsuit against Univision. Always fight back when right. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
I love the Mexican people but Mexico is not our friend. They're killing us at the border and they're killing us on jobs and trade. FIGHT!
We MUST have strong borders and stop illegal immigration. Without that we do not have a country. Also Mexico is killing U.S. on trade. WIN!

My daughter Ivanka did great tonight in New Hampshire. The sold out crowd loved her and she loved them. Thanks Ivanka!
The ratings for The View are really low. Nicole Wallace and Molly Sims are a disaster. Get new cast or just put it to sleep. Dead T.V.
I am really beginning to respect Mark Halperin and John Heilemann as political reporters - they truly get why Trump poll numbers are high.
Uncomfortable looking NBC reporter Willie Geist calls me to ask for favors and then mockingly smiles when he is told of my high poll numbers
I want to thank Elizabeth Steve

Why Donald Trump Won’t Touch Your Entitlements: DES MOINES Iowa—Donald Trump says if he runs for p... 
be personable -- but don't take things personally. That's good business.
Marco Rubio had no idea what he was doing on Chris Wallace show. Said Iraq was not a mistake. He looked clueless!
Wow ISIS has just taken the City of Ramadi in Iraq. So many of our great soldiers died in originally going after it. Such a waste.
I laugh when I see Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush pretending to love each other with each talking of their great friendship. Typical phony pols
Jeb Bush gave five different answers in four days on whether or not we should have invaded Iraq.He is so confused.Not presidential material!
I am in Iowa today great STATE
Going to New Hampshire all sold out crowds. People want real change - POLS WILL NEVER MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN!
I call Jeb Bush the reluctant warrior --- he just doesn't want to be doing this he is not having fun!

Baltimore had a really tough night - only great leadership can solve the many inner-city problems facing our country. Jobs jobs
If the working proud and productive people of our country don't start exerting their authority and views
Why is no-one talking about the horrible murder of Ana Charle by ex-con thug West Spruill. Gunned down on street naked. Why no riots here?
Billions of dollars spent on Baltimore and it's still a total mess. Leadership is needed not dollars. Our whole country is going to hell!
I have been a guest on The View many times when it was successful show. Now the show is dying for lack of ratings. Too bad!
They now say using the word thug is like so many other words
I wonder what the rest of the world is thinking about the United States as they watch the disgusting and out of control Baltimore riots?
Hopefully there won't be any problems in Baltimore tonight. Be calm be cool-do not let anybody get hurt.There is just too much to live for!
The best social program by far
President Obama you have a big job to do. Go to Baltimore and bring both sides together. With proper leadership
Our country has to come together. We have to start working with and really liking

As I have long been saying South Africa is a total - and very dangerous - mess. Just watch the evening news (when not talking weather).
Just returned from New Hampshire where the crowd was great-and got a beautiful standing ovation! Wonderful people who truly love the U.S.A.
For all of the haters and losers out there sorry I never went Bankrupt -- but I did build a world class company and employ many people!

No wonder Sony is doing so badly. Really stupid leadership that wants Al Sharpton to help. Watch him turn the tables on chief Amy Pascal.
Can you believe that Sony chief Amy Pascal wants to meet with Al Sharpton to seek forgiveness for her racial slurs. Al is laughing at her!
Isn't it interesting that immediately after September 11th everybody was asking for
When terrorists are beheading and executing American citizens in such a brutal way the report on torture should be the least of our concerns
The terrorists cut off the heads of Americans and laugh then want to sell us the bodies for $1
hit them often &amp; then tell them it was because they are the enemy!
Conde Nast made a big mistake going into the World Trade Center. The place is a total disaster and I feel this is only the beginning!
People are really unhappy with the endless security checks at the new World Trade Center. Durst is a terrible manager. Tenants furious!
Durst is a disaster at operating the new World Trade Center. It takes forever for workers or visitors to get in with impossible security.
President Obama Gruber and all of the other Obama cronies got ObamaCare passed by lies and fraudulent statements. Courts should overturn!
Our country and our leaders are getting dumber all the time. Now they are about to release full documentation on torture. Will destroy CIA
They should close down Rolling Stone Magazine after the phony rape charge story. University of Virginia should sue them for big bucks!
ObamaCare failing &amp; over budget. Don’t worry our president is still fundraising  Priorities
The cast of the new season of apprenticenbc. Premieres January 4th on NBC. 
Bill Cosby is foolish stupid
Why would they announce a finding of the grand jury in Ferguson at 9:00 in the evening - a prime time for riots! Not smart.
Iran and the United States just pushed deadline back SEVEN MONTHS on working out a nuclear deal. Iran is tapping along our bad negotiators!
#TrumpVlog Hagel quits- 
Tom Brady played great today. He is a total champ and a really nice guy a rare combination!
Do you think the 14 African nations that are banning West Africans from coming into their nations are racist?
There are many Jonathan Gruber types selling the global warming stuff - and they really do believe the American public is stupid.
Repeal &amp; Replace!

The entire country is FREEZING - we desperately need a heavy dose of global warming and fast! Ice caps size reaches all time high.

So Obama's top people responsible for ObamaCare think the American Public is stupid! All based on lies and deception! Repubs should sue.

Obama’s trip to China &amp; the 2014 election results 
Remember we don't get any oil from Iraq
Do not go back into Iraq unless they agree in a signed formal instrument
We spent TWO TRILLION DOLLARS in Iraq and got NOTHING. Now we are going back and will again get NOTHING because our leaders are clueless!
We are now sending thousands of additional troops to Iraq to teach them how to fight - they will run billions wasted! WHAT DOES U.S. GET?
stopping Obamacare
The new Congress must restore military spending &amp; stop Obama budget cuts. Also hold Obama accountable on the VA.
A really bad night for President Obama. Now the Republicans have to get together and get the job done!
One year ago I started calling President Obama INCOMPETENT and people thought it was too tough. Tonight everyone is using that word!
Looking like a really big night for Republicans - a tremendous refutation of President Obama and his failed policies!
slow growth
#TrumpAdvice 
I told you that the Giants starting Hudson was a mistake. Just got knocked out of the game. I love being right!
DC Post Office
President Obama strongly considering a plan to bring non-U.S. citizens with Ebola to the United States for treatment. Now I know he's nuts!
Fox &amp; Friends going on now - enjoy!
There are just so many penalties and such long commercials in these NFL games that they are no longer worth watching. Soft hitting &amp; boring!
I would absolutely consider investing in Atlantic City again great and hard working people
Yes I won the right to have my name taken off Trump Plaza in A.C. because it was not operated up to a very high standard and NO involvement
I made a fortune in Atlantic City got out years ago (great timing)
With all that is happening with Ebola including the doctor who so easily came back to New York
#TrumpVlog Obama should be ashamed! 
The Ebola doctor who just flew to N.Y. from West Africa and went on the subway bowling and dining is a very SELFISH man-should have known!
President Obama you are a complete and total disaster
President Obama has a major meeting on the N.Y.C. Ebola outbreak with people flying in from all over the country
I never thought I'd say it in my lifetime but President Barack Hussein Obama
I have been saying for weeks for President Obama to stop the flights from West Africa. So simple but he refused. A TOTAL incompetent!
Ebola has been confirmed in N.Y.C. with officials frantically trying to find all of the people and things he had contact with.Obama's fault
If this doctor who so recklessly flew into New York from West Africa
There is a good possibility that a person who treated patients in West Africa and who FLEW into New York has Ebola. Touched many bedlam!
Double digit premium increases because of ObamaCare. Dems trying to delay showing numbers until after election but news is spreading fast!
Tremendous pressure on President Obama to institute a travel ban on Ebola stricken West Africa. At some point this stubborn dope will fold!
The United States troops which were sent to West Africa have only gotten 4 hours of Ebola training - very unfair to them and their families!
The United States under President Obama
The U.S. accidentally air dropped a large shipment of military weapons and supplies right into the middle of ISIS as enemy laughs! Very sad!
Oscar Pistorious will likely only serve 10 months for the cold blooded murder of his girlfriend. Another O.J. travesty.The judge is a moron!
Wow one of the all-time greats in fashion
Oscar Pistorius only gets five years in prison for killing his girlfriend. Ridiculous decision! Judge couldn't even read her own writings.
I was never a fan of Bush in fact
I just returned from Iowa - what a beautiful state. The people are amazing and the event for Congressman Steve King was a great success!
Do you believe Obama just said that America would be less safe with a travel ban from West Africa.This is the thinking of a total mad man!
The lobbyist and political hack that President Obama just appointed as the Ebola Czar just missed his first major meeting on Ebola-A joke
I'm leaving for Iowa now - will be great!
If I were president Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi would be let out of jail with one phone call. If not Mexico would pay a price like never before!
Do you think the 14 African nations that are banning West Africans from coming into their nations are being called racists? Perhaps not!
14 African nations have totally banned West Africans from entering their nations. Likewise many other nations. But the U.S. = COME ON IN
Obama just appointed an Ebola Czar with zero experience in the medical area and zero experience in infectious disease control. A TOTAL JOKE!
chase your dreams with resolute focus &amp; determination. Be positive!
Says Ebola Is Further Proof Of Obama's Incompetence” 
Coming soon to Pennsylvania Avenue 
Looks like Obama will not stop the very potentially dangerous flights to and from West Africa. What the hell is wrong with this guy?
The Ebola nurse should NEVER have been allowed to fly to Cleveland and (amazing) back again. Nothing works in our once great country anymore
As ISIS and Ebola spread like wildfire the Obama administration just submitted a paper on how to stop climate change (aka global warming).
Can you believe that with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S.
Are NFL games getting boring or is it just my magnificent imagination? In any event I'm just not watching them much anymore!
I will be on Fox &amp; Friends tomorrow morning at 7.00. Ebola and ISIS will be topics.
I don't know if President Obama isn't stopping the flights from Ebola torn West Africa because he is stubborn stupid
Here we go - A healthcare worker who treated Thomas Duncan the man who flew into the U.S. from West Africa infected with Ebola
President Obama NOW
Remember when I said when Saddam Hussein fell - the new leader of Iraq will be meaner and tougher and hate the U.S. even more. Welcome ISIS!
If a conservative Republican made the mistake that Mrs. Obama just made by calling Braley by the wrong name it would be the biggest story!
Michelle Obama made a terrible mistake in Iowa. When endorsing Bruce Braley before a large crowd she called him Bruce Bailey seven times.
Isn't it ridiculous starting today
Do you notice that because of Ebola ISIS etc.
If you are interested in balancing work and pleasure you will never succeed!
I feel sorry for the 4000 soldiers who are being forced to go the West Africa to fight Ebola. Their families are up in arms. Not trained.
Tens of millions of dollars in airstrikes had no impact because key leaders fled after hearing ON NEWS REPORTS the strikes were coming. DUMB
Even Jimmy Carter just released a statement saying that Obama doesn't have a clue. That has to be a new low!
Obama stop the flights to and from West Africa NOW - before it is too late! Can't you see what's happening? Can you be that thick (stupid)?
Can you believe this fool Dr. Thomas Frieden of CDC
2016 elections 
Stop the flights! 
Despite the ever increasing Ebola disaster Obama refuses to stop flights from West Africa.It's almost like he's saying F-you to U.S. public
President Obama I have an idea! Pretend that West Africa is Israel and then you will be able to stop the Ebola area flights.
President Obama - close down the flights from Ebola infected areas right now before it is too late! What the hell is wrong with you?
Something very important and indeed society changing
This Ebola patient Thomas Duncan who fraudulently entered the U.S. by signing false papers
If Ebola is so non-contagious how come an NBC cameraman caught it so quickly while over in West Africa? U.S. is behaving very foolishly!
Can you believe that President Obama still hasn't stopped the flights and people pouring into the U.S. from West Africa. TERRIBLE PRESIDENT!
Saw Michael Jordan and Ray Allen today playing golf at Trump National Doral the Blue Monster. Great guys!
Ebola patient Duncan lied on his exit papers by saying he never came into contact with a person with Ebola. He knew he did and person died.
How incompetent are our leaders allowing these Ebola infected people to come into our country with all of the problems and danger entailed!
The Ebola patient who came into our country knew exactly what he was doing. Came into contact with over 100 people.Here we go-I told you so!
The brand new hotel at Trump National Doral has the most beautiful rooms and suites in Miami. Enjoy!
I just arrived at Trump National Doral in Miami where I'll spend the day checking work just completed by contractors. This place is amazing!
Ebola is much easier to transmit than the CDC and government representatives are admitting. Spreading all over Africa-and fast. Stop flights
The United States must immediately institute strong travel restrictions or Ebola will be all over the United States-a plague like no other!
How dumb is our president to send thousands of poorly trained and ill-equipped soldiers over to West Africa to fight Ebola. Stop all flights
The animal who beheaded the woman in Oklahoma should be given a very fast trial and then the death penalty. The same fate - beheading?
I wonder if I run for PRESIDENT will the haters and losers vote for me knowing that I will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN? I say they will!
Can you believe we still have not gotten our Marine out of Mexico. He sits in prison while our PRESIDENT plays golf and makes bad decisions!
According to many ISIS was given so much time and so many signals as to when we would start bombing that they were able to prepare and hide
The NFL image is really tarnished! Now if the sponsors start leaving and the ratings go down
They just called this the biggest scandal in U.S. sports history (GMA). Roger looks really weak and indecisive must put on a better front!
What separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate.
Do you believe that Obama is giving weapons to moderate rebels in Syria.Isn't sure who they are. What the hell is he doing.Will turn on us
Why are we sending thousands of ill-trained soldiers into Ebola infested areas of Africa! Bring the plague back to U.S.? Obama is so stupid.
In order to stop the Ebola outbreak in Africa perhaps the President should put all Africans on ObamaCare rather than sending the troops!
Money was never a big motivation for me except as a way to keep score. The real excitement is playing the game!
The judge in the Oscar Pistorious case is a total moron. She said he didn't act like a killer. This is another O.J. disaster!
Can you believe that our very stupid politicians released the leader of ISIS and now we are spending billions trying to get him back!
Tell Saudi Arabia and others that we want (demand!) free oil for the next ten years or we will not protect their private Boeing 747s.Pay up!
Middle Eastern countries must participate militarily (no running away) and big league financially in order for us to go in and save them!
I just want to know how much is Saudi Arabia and others who we are helping willing to pay for our saving from total extinction. Pay up now!
I made a great deal of money in Atlantic City but left years ago when I saw so many political mistakes being made. I have ZERO involvement!
Getting ready to pay final respect to GREAT LADY Joan Rivers. She could light up a room like no other! She will be greatly missed.
We just finished shooting a new season of Celebrity Apprentice and happily for all Joan plays my advisor in two episodes. She was great!
Joan Rivers had great talent but also truly amazing stamina and drive - she would never give up or quit. That is why she became a champion!
I will be going to the funeral of my friend Joan Rivers today. I got to know her really well when she became the winner of The Apprentice!
Remember anything you read about Atlantic City has nothing to do with me. I sold years ago and left. Good timing but very sad!
I just started construction of The Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue in D.C. Many jobs. Will be finest hotel in U.S. Watch it happen!
Attention all hackers: You are hacking everything else so please hack Obama's college records (destroyed?) and check place of birth
President Obama has just reached an ALL-TIME low approval rating! Is anybody surprised? The happiest person is former President Jimmy Carter
I'm not saying to not give vaccines I am just saying give them small doses over a long period of time - not one massive dose for a child.
We have got to get our Marine out of that disgusting Mexican jail. Would be so easy if we had a real leader. One tough phone call &amp; he's out

Emmy Awards show was terrible last night. Same shows winning over and over again (politics). Amazing race a joke. Host Seth Meyers bombed!
The Greater Miami area and numerous others are fighting hard to get the Miss Universe Pageant. A decision will be made very soon!
ISIS made a big mistake with the beheading of the reporter. Even people against intervention want them blown into oblivion. LEADERSHIP!
We need a President who isn't a laughing stock to the entire World. We need a truly great leader a genius at strategy and winning. Respect!
The World as we know it is falling apart. Much of the blame can be attributed to the fact that the United States is no longer respected!
will Obama hold today?
The fact that we are taking the Ebola patients while others from the area are fleeing to the United States
The U.S. must immediately stop all flights from EBOLA infected countries or the plague will start and spread inside our borders. Act fast!
If you read my last number of tweets only one opinion can be formed - that our President
The U.S. cannot allow EBOLA infected people back. People that go to far away places to help out are great-but must suffer the consequences!
Ebola patient will be brought to the U.S. in a few days - now I know for sure that our leaders are incompetent. KEEP THEM OUT OF HERE!
It's late in July and it is really cold outside in New York. Where the hell is GLOBAL WARMING??? We need some fast! It's now CLIMATE CHANGE

I try to learn from the past but I plan for the future by focusing exclusively on the present. That's where the fun is!

I believe that President Obama is so overwhelmed by what is happening in the U.S. and throughout the World that he has totally given up!
I will be on Fox &amp; Friends at 7.00 (20 minutes). Plenty of terrible and tragic news to talk about! Too bad.
&amp; all will be well – Trump Never Give Up

Can you imagine trading five really bad enemies of the U.S. for the freedom of traitor Bergdahl. Just another bad deal!
Deserter Bergdahl returns to active duty as parents of brave soldiers killed looking for him grieve. Obama trying to play this mistake down!
The only global warming that people should be concerned with is the global warming caused by nuclear weapons because of our weak U.S. leader
The new hot term that they have recently invented is POLAR VORTEX - give me a break!
They only changed the term to CLIMATE CHANGE when the words GLOBAL WARMING didn't work anymore. Come on people get smart!
I can't believe that 60 Minutes is right now showing our nuclear facilities for the world to see (at request of U.S. leadership). STUPID!
THE HARDER YOU WORK THE LUCKIER YOU GET!
Rosie is back on the View which tells you how desperate they must be. It is the standard short term fix and long term disaster.

How much money are the lawyers for the Central Park Five getting out of the 40 million dollars or are they paid by the City (or both)?
N.Y. City is paying FORTY MILLION DOLLARS to five men that many think are guilty as hell. So many facts - should have been trial. Politics!
AMERICA USED TO BE THE LEADER OF THE WORLD. THANKS TO OBAMA AMERICA ISN'T EVEN LEADING FROM BEHIND.
It's time to let Pete Rose the all time hits leader
I bought the great Turnberry Resort today - considered by many to have the greatest golf course in the World. I will take good care of it!
Will be doing Fox &amp; Friends at 7 - 2 minutes.
I'd bet the horrible look of Pinehurst translates into poor television ratings. This is not what golf is about!
I would like to wish all fathers even the haters and losers
I have been very consistent and always said that Iraq would fall as soon as the U.S. left. What a terrible waste of lives and money!
Iran will convince our incompetent President that they are trying to help us with Iraq take over the country &amp; oil
Turnberry in Scotland is a far superior golf course to Pinehurst - and it isn't even close! Likewise the Blue Monster at Doral.
Iran is moving troops into Iraq under the guise that it is helping out. Actually they will take over Iraq and all of their oil. Stupid U.S.
The Iraqi Army is useless. President Obama stay the hell out of Iraq (we should never have been there in the first place).
We should never have gone into Iraq but once in
I told all of the haters and losers long ago that Iraq would fall take the OIL or get out fast! Massive waste of lives and trillions of $'s
Iraq told us to get out Iraq is now falling
Iraq is falling apart fast - two trillion dollars and so many deaths - Bush got us in and Obama took far too long to get us out!
Someone just asked me who is my favorite Donald Trump impersonator? 
is not an act but a habit. -- Aristotle
As I have said the Tea Party is alive and well and fighting hard for the USA. BIG WIN TODAY!
Tea Party takes down Eric Cantor - REALLY BIG WIN!
What I am saying is that we never should have been in Iraq in the first place. Bush was terrible Obama is worse! Make America GREAT again.
I told you so a long time ago: Iraq just lost second largest city as their soldiers drop their guns and run. Only the beginning! OIL.
Five U.S. soldiers killed in Afghanistan by so-called friendly fire. What are we doing?
Heading over to the Miss USA Pageant. The young women participating are amazing and accomplished. Competition is very tough. ENJOY THE SHOW!
The man made climate change that our great president should be focused on is of the NUCLEAR variety brought upon us because of weakness!
The Miss U.S.A. pageant will be amazing tonight. To be politically incorrect the girls (women) are REALLY BEAUTIFUL. NBC at 8 PM.
I believe that in addition to the 5 terrorist leaders President Obama gave up for Bergdahl a great deal of CASH was also given. So stupid!
is the pinnacle of style &amp; prestige. Dress your best! 
The five Taliban leaders released for a deserter must really be laughing and having a good time right now. They are saying how dumb U.S. is!
Our President is a great embarrassment to the U.S. How could anybody be so dumb or know so little as to make the very stupid 5 for 1 swap?
lose and win again and again is often called the entrepreneurial spirit.” – Midas Touch
Bowe Bergdahl walked off the base after he was told not to. Solders died looking for him. U.S. should NEVER have made the deal! PUNISHMENT?
Only a grossly incompetent government led by an equally incompetent president could have made the terrible trade for Bergdahl. #OrangeRoom
That the Obama administration didn't know the facts about who Bergdahl was before making the stupid 5 killers for one trade is pathetic!
The U.S. cannot negotiate with terrorists. It is a sad and terrible situation for the family involved but this can only lead to disaster.
What does.Obama know about the VA or business - nothing just look at the five billion dollar ObamaCare website. We need a real leader!
Have a great and peaceful Memorial Day - but remember there are people out there who don't want us to have peace. WE MUST BE STRONG!!!!
Sometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war. Don't ever get down on yourself just keep fighting - in the end

We must stop releasing hard core criminals all over the United States. Our country must be strong again!
Getting ready for the big news conference in Dubai. It should all be happening in the U.S. but it isn't - SAD!
Time Warner cable out AGAIN in Manhattan - no television. They have a real problem!
Rosie O'Donnell just said she felt shame at being fat-not politically correct! She killed Star Jones for weight loss surgery just had it!
A rare case where the U.S. should help-

I will be doing Fox &amp; Friends in 10 minutes at 7.00. Many things to talk about! ENJOY
Have a great weekend everyone and for those of you that are young entrepreneurs have fun but never stop thinking of the task ahead- victory
Wow Vanity Fair was totally shut out at the National Magazine Awards - it got NOTHING. Graydon Carter is a loser with bad food restaurants!
The way President Obama runs down the stairs of Air Force 1 hopping &amp; bobbing all the way
Huffington Post is just upset that I said its purchase by AOL has been a disaster and that Arianna Huffington is ugly both inside and out!
Have to go now to sign a great and job producing deal! Good night.
I give Secretary of State John Kerry credit for working and trying hard but he has zero negotiating ability!
Remember Russia still has Snowden. When are we going to bring that piece of human garbage back home to stand trial? He caused great damage!
who has given them (&amp; everyone) massive US secrets.

Al Sharpton said they are even making it more harder to register people to vote. Which is worse his grammar or his thoughts?

Coach W to his basketball players - BE QUICK BUT DON'T HURRY!
If I were President I would push for proper vaccinations but would not allow one time massive shots that a small child cannot take - AUTISM.
Autism WAY UP - I believe in vaccinations but not massive all at once
and LEAD! Watch Russia closely
The situation with Russia is much more dangerous than most people may think - and could lead to World War III. WE NEED GREAT LEADERSHIP FAST
We should be building up our military and our missile defense systems to their highest levels ever. Must be very strong to prosper &amp; survive
I believe Putin will continue to re-build the Russian Empire. He has zero respect for Obama or the U.S.!
Putin has become a big hero in Russia with an all time high popularity. Obama on the other hand
When nobody wanted the UFC I opened the way by letting them fight at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City. Dana White has done a great job!
Frumpy and very dumb Gail Collins an editorial writer at The New York Times
While I won't be running for Governor of New York State a race I would have won
The top leadership of the New York State Republican Party is totally dysfunctional - they haven't won a major election in many years.
I have clearly stated that if the New York State Republican Party is able to unify I would run for Governor and win. They can't unify -SAD!
I just beat a lawyer from Yale and a lawyer from Harvard who teamed up against me
Will be on Fox &amp; Friends at 7 (10 minutes). ENJOY!
Leaders at Trump National Doral are only one under par. The great Ben Hogan said I've never seen a great course that was easy!
The newly built Blue Monster at Trump National Doral is being considered a masterpiece by almost all who see it and play it - THANK YOU!
Little Andy Lassner who lives his life through Ellen and has nothing else going for himself

Sissy Graydon Carter of failing Vanity Fair Magazine and owner of bad food restaurants has a problem-his V.F. Oscar party is no longer hot
I'll be playing golf tomorrow in Palm Beach at the number one rated golf course in the State of Florida Trump International Golf Club.
The World is falling apart around us but we don't have people who know how to play the game. The U.S. is in big trouble - no leadership!
The U.S. has appealed ro Russia not to intervene in Ukraine - Russia tells U.S. they will not become involved and then laughs loudly!
Obama just stated he didn't take school seriously made bad choices and GOT HIGH - then how the hell did he get into Columbia &amp; Harvard?
Iraq buying $200 000
Will be doing Fox &amp; Friends at 7 A.M. - 20 minutes. ENJOY!
Russia beat the United States in the Olympics-another Obama embarrassment! Isn't it time that we turn things around and start kicking ass?
The brand new Blue Monster Golf Course at Trump National Doral is doing fantastic business. Also the new driving range is open at night!
A dishonest slob of a reporter who doesn't understand my sarcasm when talking about him or his wife
The Blue Monster Golf Course officially opens tomorrow at Trump National Doral with a ribbon cutting ceremony. GREAT COURSE GREAT REVIEWS!
Wow just in - ObamaCare projected to cause large scale drop in jobs - even Dems are shocked by 2.5 million number. DISASTER!
When will our country stop wasting money on global warming and so many other truly STUPID things and begin to focus on lower taxes?
Massive record setting snowstorm and freezing temperatures in U.S. Smart that GLOBAL WARMING hoaxsters changed name to CLIMATE CHANGE! $$$$
and come back tough next year.
I can't get over after all of the buildup
This may be the worst football game ever played by one team Denver! Hard to watch.
Enjoy the Super Bowl!
Snowing in Texas and Louisiana record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!
Do you really believe our once great country can continue to survive with incompetent leadership. The answer is no and we better move fast!
Any and all weather events are used by the GLOBAL WARMING HOAXSTERS to justify higher taxes to save our planet! They don't believe it $$$$!
NBC News just called it the great freeze - coldest weather in years. Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?
focus and hard work. Momentum keeps it all going.
Yankees should have dropped A-Rod long ago not even bothered with arbitration. They would have saved a fortune!
I will be doing Fox &amp; Friends tomorrow morning at 7.00. Will be discussing all sorts of current disasters!
Whether you like Obama or not Bob Gates turned out to be one disloyal dude! Personally
be personable
This very expensive GLOBAL WARMING bullshit has got to stop. Our planet is freezing record low temps
Today is the first day of the rest of your life - make the most of it!
Have a happy successful and healthy New Year!
When it comes to money finance and even life
Spend your last day of 2013 contemplating the moves you will make in 2014 to make it your best year ever!
The con artists changed the name from GLOBAL WARMING to CLIMATE CHANGE when GLOBAL WARMING was no longer working and credibility was lost!
What the hell is going on with GLOBAL WARMING. The planet is freezing the ice is building and the G.W. scientists are stuck-a total con job
Temperature at record lows in many parts of the country. 50 degrees below zero with wind chill in large area. Global warming folks iced in!
In the upcoming New Year we will focus like never before - if we do that we will have complete and total VICTORY in all we do!
We're coming up on the NEW YEAR-It is really important that despite so many stupid decisions being made in Washington
The global warming scientists don't want to be airlifted off the ship-they are having too much fun and that is too simple a solution-FAME!
We should be focused on clean and beautiful air-not expensive and business closing GLOBAL WARMING-a total hoax!
The rescue icebreaker trying to free the ship of the GLOBAL WARMING scientists
Without passion you don't have energy and without energy
beautiful restaurant.
This is one of the COLDEST WINTERS ever freezing all over the country for long periods of time! So much for GLOBAL WARMING.
It's amazing how badly the Knicks and Nets are playing. Everybody predicted they would be top teams with all of the money spent. Too bad!
Denver Minnesota and others are bracing for some of the coldest weather on record. What are the global warming geniuses saying about this?
You can only smile when the losers of the world try so hard to put down successful people. Just remember they all want to be YOU!
With few exceptions only really smart people are able to make a lot of money. Hard work is also important
That was a great football game.
Wow the ObamaCare website
Today is the day that ObamaCare website was supposed to be up and working. WRONG-website is closed down a total disaster! 90 million doomed
Work is fun deals are fun
ALWAYS BORROW MONEY FROM A PESSIMIST BECAUSE HE WILL NEVER EXPECT IT TO BE PAID BACK!
I will be going to Trump National Doral in Miami early today to check on the construction of the hotel and the new Blue Monster. AMAZING!
How did the NCAA which is weak and becoming irrelevant
Maybe some of the dead voters who helped get President Obama elected can be brought back to life after signing up for ObamaCare.
The wimps that run Penn State should be forced to resign (and be sued) for the pathetic settlement they made and destruction of great legacy
President Obama is the best thing that ever happened to Jimmy Carter!
In a new poll a majority of people felt the president knowingly lied about health care pledge. Who are the fools who don't think he lied?
someone who is not a US citizen. Incompetent.
No matter how far down a path you go if it's the wrong path
ObamaCare is on LIFE SUPPORT - it will soon be DEAD ON ARRIVAL - A bad concept that was imcompetently administered!
President Obama is under pressure from Democrats to undo his lie on ObamaCare. His problem is that such a move would end ObamaCare.
Happy Veterans Day to ALL in particular to the haters and losers who have no idea how lucky they are!!!
WE WILL ONLY BE THE LAND OF THE FREE AS LONG AS WE ARE HOME OF THE BRAVE!
Don't worry when our country starts hurting bad enough from all of the mistakes that are being made
If Justice Roberts had done the right thing and voted against ObamaCare our country would be in a lot better shape right now! TOTAL TURMOIL
Drew Brees is having a great game - a fantastic quarterback and really good guy!
If we could force Russia China and other competitors to use ObamaCare
How come Snowden and ObamaCare have access to all records and information but don't have even the smallest tidbits on President Obama?
ObamaCare is a disaster and Snowden is a spy who should be executed-but if it and he could reveal Obama's records I might become a major fan
It is now a FACT that President Obama lied in order to get ObamaCare passed-that is fraud and the legislation should be recinded-INTERESTING
I told you this three years ago.
Will be on Fox &amp; Friends tomorrow morning at 7.00. Will be discussing the disgusting and wasteful $635 million website rollout and more!
The new line of Trump ties shirts and cufflinks are out at Macy's and are really beautiful at a really reasonable.price. Go check them out!
President Obama should bring Secretaty Sebelius into his office look right into her beautiful blue eyes and say
Good night everyone - sleep well and tomorrow have many victories!
I must say that some of these college football games are great tonight-very exciting-I wish I had more time to watch!
I try to learn from the past but I plan for the future by focusing exclusively on the present. That's where the fun is. ~Donald Trump
When a complex website is broken the best thing to do is blow it up and start all over again-then sue the culprits and use the proper team!
Obama is the most profligate deficit &amp; debt spender in our nation’s history. Doubled debt (cont) 
If the U.S. Government doesn't give the money necessary for the burials of our military personnel I will.The U.S. under Obama's leadership!
It is outrageous and disgusting that families of U.S. MILITARY personnel killed in action will not be given money for burials. SAD!
The Republicans can absolutely win if they stick together-but they are NOT sticking together. Sen. McCain just said we can't win.Very bad!
The Emmys are sooooo boring! Terrible show. I'm going to watch football! I already know the winners. Good night.
I cannot believe that Apple didn't come out with a larger screen IPhone. Samsung is stealing their business. STEVE JOBS IS SPINNING IN GRAVE

Wow Eliot Spitzer has lost - great news for New York City!
Bottom line I don't think President changed people's minds - must hope for a lifeline from Putin
We will have to see what Russia's next move will be. They may have given him an out of an embarrassing situation or drove into deeper mess!
He is working hard and for that he must be given credit!
Doesn't want to remove Assad - worries what comes next.
Making his case in a nice and articulate manner.
Does he look sharp smart and presidential-his hands keep hitting the podium
Here we go!
Will be covering President Obama's speech at 9.00 on Twitter-you are all so lucky!
I am not angry at Russia (or China) because their leaders are far smarter than ours. We need real leadership and fast
I wonder how much our leaders have promised or given
Really bad news just announced concerning jobs. Far fewer jobs created in August than anticipated. Interest rates therefore
We don't have the leadership including the Generals (who just said the element of surprise does not matter) to attack anyone! Cool it.
Did you ever see a situation so ridiculous as our President explaining what when and where to Congress about a Syrian attack. Far too late!
It is truly amateur hour at the White House - and this is why we should not be doing the war thing right now!
Fox and Friends

Obama should meet with Putin snd convince him to do what is good for the U.S. It's called good dealmaking or simply
Why has all time hits leader Pete Rose paid a 20 year price whrn A-Rod gets 200 game penalty. It's time to let Pete into The Hall of Fame!
The Old Post Office building in Washington (D.C.) will soon be transformed into one of the great hotels anywhere in the world-lots of jobs!
We.signed our deal to take over the historic Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Ave. from the U.S. and convert it into super luxury hotel-jobs!
Let me sum this up for you... 
Isn't it sad the way Putin is toying with Obama regarding Snowden. We look weak and pathetic. Could not happen with.a strong leader!
I've just started blocking out some of the repetitive and boring (&amp; dumb) haters and losers. They are a waste of time and energy!
Greta in a few minutes-will be interesting!

China is taking the oil from Iraq after we spent 1.5 trillion dollars and thousands of lives for their freedom. Our leaders are so stupid!
500 of the most vicious prisoners escaped from an Iraq prison today. That country is a time bomb waiting to happen-a total corrupt mess!
China is building 50 brand new airports while our country continues to rott! Very sad.
Apple is finally considering a large screen for the I-Phone-they better get moving fast. When I told them to do this last year they scoffed

Just left Trump National Doral in Miami - under massive construction - The Blue Monster will be one of the greatest courses ever built!
26 000 sexual assaults or rapes reported in military last year-and that is just the number that is reported (many do not want to report).
Sexual assault and rape in the Armed Forces is a Massive problem that nobody wants to talk about or do anything about-the big dark secret!
Head of Air Force's anti-sexual assault unit arrested for sexual assault! It just seems that our Country is not what it used to be.
Scotland does not have free press even when you are just stating the facts-it's crazy!
Don't forget to watch Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9pm...you will love it!
I don't know how Al Michaels could have been drunk and arrested on Friday night if he was totally sharp on Saturday morning.
